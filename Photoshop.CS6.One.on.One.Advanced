 ** Welcome to One-on-One

00:04: Hello! This is Deke McClelland.

00:06: Welcome to Photoshop CS6 One-on-One: Advanced, 
part three in a series of four video courses

00:13: devoted to your ultimate mastery of the 
world's most powerful image editing software.

00:19: One-on-One is all about 
project-based learning.

00:22: You learn, not so much by listening to me lecture 
you or even by watching me create pretty pictures,

00:28: but by rolling up your sleeves and 
creating compelling projects for yourself.

00:33: That way, you'll be better prepared to 
create your own projects in the future.

00:38: In this course, you'll learn how Smart Objects 
protect your images from harm and allow you

00:44: to create copies linked to a single original.

00:47: You'll use a Curves Adjustment layer to 
correct the luminance of a challenging photograph.

00:52: You will learn everything there is to 
know about processing images in Camera RAW.

00:58: You'll create breathtaking depth of field effects in 
the Blur gallery which is new to Photoshop CS6.

01:06: You'll learn the basics of every 
blend mode available in Photoshop.

01:10: You'll define complex selections using Color 
Range and Refine Edge, and you'll experience

01:16: the power of the Pen tool which allows you 
to select anything, one point at a time.

01:23: The result is a 
contextualized learning program.

01:27: Photoshop's features make sense because you 
apply them to a clearly defined task and you

01:32: leave each chapter with a 
sense of accomplishment.

01:35: I hope there are moments, when you feel 
I rule, I've done this and I can do more.

01:41: Now that you're an advanced student, you are 
ready to move through Photoshop without anything

01:46: getting in your way.

01:47: This means three things: first you need some new 
shortcuts, ones that will call up Photoshop's

01:53: best commands without you 
having to fumble through menus.

01:57: Second, you need to know how to adjust a few 
preference settings to make the program behave;

02:03: and third you need to take advantage of the best 
color settings that Photoshop has to offer.

02:09: In this first movie, I show you how 
to load my custom keyboard shortcuts.

02:13: After that, I'll show you how to 
make Photoshop the best that it can be.

 ** Loading the dekeKeys keyboard shortcuts

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to load my custom 
keyboard shortcuts which are known as dekeKeys.

00:05: And I'll also walk you through the new 
shortcuts that are available to you.

00:08: What you want to do if you're working along 
with me is go to the 23_settings folder inside

00:12: the Exercise Files folder.

00:14: And those of you by the way, who are not premium members, 
you can still download these dekeKeys from the site.

00:19: Then you want to locate the file called 
dekeKeys.PsCS6.kys and right-click on it and then choose

00:27: Open with and choose Adobe Photoshop CS6 and that 
will prevent the shortcut file from accidentally

00:33: opening inside Premiere.

00:35: That should go ahead and automatically 
switch you to Photoshop as it has in my case.

00:39: Now you won't see anything different, until 
you go up to the Edit menu and choose the

00:44: Keyboard Shortcuts command which as you can 
see has its own shortcut of mash your fist K,

00:48: so Ctrl+Shift+Alt+K on the PC or 
Cmd+Shift+Opt+K on the Mac.

00:53: And you will see that your Set has 
switched to Photoshop Defaults (modified).

00:58: And what you want to do is click on the little 
hard drive with the dot dot dot (...) that's

01:01: your Save As icon and as you can see I have 
already saved a dekeKeys file, I did that

01:06: back in the intermediate course.

01:08: I am going to name this guy, so I don't save over it, 
dekeKeys PsCS6, like so, and then click the Save button.

01:15: You can call your shortcuts 
anything you like, by the way.

01:18: And then just to make sure the shortcuts have 
loaded successfully, go ahead and twirl open

01:22: the File menu and you should see that Open 
as Smart Object now has a keyboard shortcut

01:27: of Ctrl+Shift+Alt+O or 
Cmd+Shift+Opt+O on the Mac.

01:31: Assuming that's the case, go ahead and click OK 
and you now have my shortcuts loaded. All right.

01:36: Let's talk about what that means.

01:38: I'll go ahead and minimize Photoshop and 
notice in this 23_settings folder, we also have a

01:42: couple of HTML files, one is a list of the 
Macintosh shortcuts and the other is the list

01:47: of the Windows shortcuts.

01:49: We'll go ahead and minimize this folder window 
as well, so that you can see that I've loaded

01:53: both shortcut files in the background.

01:55: And notice that the PC shortcuts over here 
in the left-hand side and the Mac shortcuts

01:59: over on the right-hand side are organized 
differently, because the Macintosh version

02:03: of Photoshop includes a Photoshop 
menu which does not appear on the PC.

02:06: I have gone ahead and annotated the Command key 
using the Cloverleaf character which actually

02:11: appears on the keyboard, and I've listed every 
single shortcut that's available to you whether

02:16: I created it or not.

02:18: My custom keyboard shortcuts 
appear in red throughout the table.

02:22: So let's walk through a few of them here.

02:24: First of all, you can open an image as 
a Smart Object by using that shortcut.

02:28: Then I've given you a shortcut for the Place command 
as well and if you scroll down a little bit,

02:32: you will see that I altered the shortcut 
for Paste in Place to Ctrl+Alt+V instead of

02:37: Ctrl+Shift+V that would be Cmd+Opt+V on the Mac 
and that allowed me to assign Ctrl+Shift+V

02:42: or Cmd+Shift+V on the Mac to 
creating a Variations Adjustment layer.

02:46: I have given you a shortcut for the Stroke 
command under the Edit menu as well, very

02:50: useful command, and Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P 
on the Mac will now bring up the Preset Manager,

02:55: we have got a couple of shortcuts to 
assign or convert to color profiles.

02:59: I have created a new shortcut for Brightness/
Contrast which is Ctrl+/ that's Cmd+/ on the Mac

03:05: and if we keep going down here, you will see 
right there is Ctrl+Alt+H or Cmd+Opt+H

03:10: for Shadows/Highlights.

03:12: On the Mac, Cmd+Opt+H or Ctrl+Alt+H 
normally invokes the Hide Others command which

03:16: is why I've adjusted that 
keyboard shortcut for you.

03:19: You just need to add the Ctrl key now, so 
it's Cmd+Ctrl+Opt+H in order to hide

03:24: others and also notice Cmd+Ctrl+H will 
hide Photoshop and that's because Cmd+H

03:30: or Ctrl+H on the PC hides a selection outline.

03:33: I have given you a new shortcut for Desaturate 
which is mash your fist U, so Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U

03:38: on the PC, Cmd+Shift+Opt+U on the Mac.

03:41: You can see that we have got a slew of shortcuts 
for whole image operations, such as rotating

03:45: the image clockwise which is mash your fist 
right bracket (]), that's Ctrl+Shift+Alt+]

03:50: on a PC or Cmd on the Mac.

03:53: I've given you a shortcut for the Trim command 
which is Ctrl+Shift+Alt+C, that C is for cropping

03:58: away the blank pixels, that's 
Cmd+Shift+Opt+C on the Mac.

04:02: We've got Ctrl+Shift+Alt+D or Cmd+Shift+Opt+D for 
duplicate and Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L or Cmd+Shift+Opt+L

04:07: for the Calculations command which is this 
advanced masking function which we'll take

04:11: a look at in the mastery course.

04:14: Moving right along here, we've got Ctrl+Shift+O 
or Cmd+Shift+O for Blending Options and

04:19: notice here I've given you a shortcut for 
deleting the Filter Mask, just because Photoshop

04:23: always gives you a Filter Mask and you may or 
may not want to use it and that's Ctrl+Alt+Q

04:28: here on the PC or Cmd+Opt+Q on the Mac.

04:31: We've now got Ctrl+Shift or Cmd+Shift 
keyboard shortcuts for the best of the Adjustment

04:36: layers, so that should come in handy for you.

04:38: We have got Ctrl+, and some variations that's 
Cmd+, on the Mac in order to convert an

04:42: image to a Smart Object and you can see down here, 
Ctrl+Alt+[ or Cmd+Opt+[ on the Mac

04:48: will go ahead and reverse the order of 
selected layers and then finally, where the

04:53: commands are concerned, I've given you Ctrl+Shift+Alt+A or 
Cmd+Shift+Opt+A on the Mac to flatten the image.

04:59: In the past, I've used Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F or 
Cmd+Shift+Opt+F, however that's been

05:03: reassigned to Finding layers inside Photoshop CS6, 
so my reasoning was the A is for flatten all.

05:10: I am going to go ahead and skip all the way 
down here to the tools and you can look through

05:15: your chart, if you like to 
see what else has changed.

05:17: But notice that I've given you the N key to 
switch between the Blur, Sharpen and Smudge tools

05:22: because by default, they don't have 
shortcuts and the N key goes unused and then

05:28: finally, way down here, if you're working 
inside a Hue/Saturation, Black and White or

05:33: Curves Adjustment layer then you have access 
to this thing called the Targeted Adjustment tool

05:37: and I've given it a keyboard shortcut of K 
because K was the only key left. All right.

05:43: So that takes care of 
your new custom shortcuts.

05:46: You should be able to power through the 
software that much more efficiently.

05:49: In the next movie, I'll show you Macintosh 
folks how to adjust your operating system

05:54: level shortcuts so that they don't 
interfere with Photoshop so everybody gets along.

05:59: Those of you working on a PC can skip ahead 
to the movie after that in which we'll take

06:03: a look at preference settings.

 ** Remapping your Macintosh OS shortcuts

00:00: This movie is specifically 
designed for Macintosh folks.

00:02: So, if you're working on a PC, go 
ahead and skip to the next movie.

00:06: The idea here is I am going to show you how 
to change our OS level keyboard shortcuts,

00:10: so that everything works as 
advertised inside of Photoshop.

00:14: Now I happened to be working in OS 10.7 that 
is to say, Lion, if you're working in Snow

00:19: Leopard or earlier, or some later version of 
the operating system, then things may work

00:23: a little differently, but at least you will have a 
sense for the options that you are looking for.

00:27: So I am going to start things 
off here at the Finder level.

00:30: Your Desktop maybe a little more 
cluttered, that's nothing to worry about.

00:33: Go up to the Apple menu and 
choose System Preferences.

00:36: And then you want to click on 
the icon labeled Keyboard.

00:39: Now the first thing you want to do is turn on 
this checkbox, Use all, F1, F2, et cetera, keys

00:44: as standard function keys, that way these 
keys will bring up panels and so forth inside

00:48: of Photoshop as opposed to, for 
example, changing the volume.

00:52: If you do want to change the volume on your 
computer, then you just go ahead and press

00:56: the Fn key along with for example F12 
in order to raise the volume that is.

01:00: Next I am going to switch over to the Keyboard 
Shortcuts panel and we'll start off with this

01:04: very first option Launchpad and Dock and I 
want you to click on this keyboard shortcut

01:09: for turning the dock hiding on and off.

01:11: By default it's set to Cmd+Opt+D.

01:13: You want to click on it a couple of times 
there, so that it's active like so and then

01:18: I recommend you press Ctrl+D, that is the 
Ctrl key the one that's labeled Ctrl along

01:24: with D at the same time and that should 
change your keyboard shortcut, so it looks like a

01:28: little caret (^) which 
indicates the Ctrl key along with D.

01:31: Next, click on Mission Control and I want 
you to click on Show Desktop right there and

01:37: go ahead and click a second time on F11 in 
order to make it active and press Ctrl+F11

01:43: instead and then do the same thing for Show 
Dashboard, that is click on F12 a couple of

01:47: times to make it active 
and then press Ctrl+F12.

01:51: Now switch to Spotlight, and this one 
can really get in the way, by the way.

01:55: The fact that it's Cmd+Space along with 
Cmd+Opt+Space, those are both shortcuts

01:59: for the Zoom tool inside Photoshop.

02:01: So go ahead and click on Cmd+Space a couple 
of times there, and press Cmd+Ctrl+Space

02:07: instead and then click on Cmd+Opt+Space a 
couple of times, and press Cmd+Ctrl+Opt+Space,

02:14: so that you end up seeing a caret followed 
by the little Options symbol followed by the

02:18: Cloverleaf and then the word Space.

02:20: Finally, click on Application Shortcuts and it 
may appear truncated as it does on my screen,

02:26: but you can drag this middle bar here in order 
to expand this left-hand list and I want you

02:30: to click on this keyboard shortcut for Show 
Help menu and by default it's Cmd+Shift+/,

02:36: go ahead and click a couple of times on that 
keyboard shortcut and change it to Ctrl+/

02:41: or something along those lines and so in my 
case, I am seeing the caret symbol along with

02:45: the Slash (/) key and 
that's all there is to it.

02:47: Now you can go ahead and close the System 
Preferences in order to Escape as well as

02:51: save your changes.

02:53: And that's how you set up your OS level 
keyboard shortcuts here on the Mac, so that you can

02:57: take advantage of my custom keyboard shortcuts 
as well as Adobe's factory default shortcuts

03:02: inside Photoshop.


 ** Adjusting a few general preferences

00:00: In this movie, we are going to transition 
from shortcuts to settings, specifically the

00:04: most important settings that are available in the 
General panel of the Preferences dialog box.

00:09: So what I'd like you to do, if you're working 
on the PC, go up to the Edit menu, on a Mac

00:12: go to the Photoshop menu and then go down 
to Preferences, it's higher in the list on

00:16: the Mac and choose the General command or 
you can press the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+K

00:21: or Cmd+K on the Mac and that's the 
universal shortcut across the Adobe applications.

00:26: Then to switch between panels, you can obviously 
click on one of these items in the left-hand list

00:30: or you can take advantage of the Keyboard 
Shortcuts, which are Ctrl+1 or Cmd+1 for General,

00:35: Ctrl+2 or Cmd+2 for Interface, 
Ctrl+3 or Cmd+3 for File Handling,

00:40: all the way up to Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0 for Type.

00:42: Anyway, I am going to switch back to General.

00:45: Now I am not going to cover every single one 
of the Preference settings because, frankly,

00:49: you don't need to know about most of them.

00:51: However there are a few key settings here 
that I want you to be aware of, starting with

00:55: Image Interpolation.

00:57: I prefer to go ahead and set this one 
to Bicubic (best for smooth gradients).

01:01: Now what I've done is I've run a series of 
tests and in my experience, this setting is

01:06: just playing the best interpolation setting 
that's available to you and the reason is,

01:11: especially for those of you work on the Web, 
you may find yourself downsampling an image

01:15: multiple times and if you choose Bicubic Automatic, 
then Photoshop goes ahead and automatically

01:21: applies Bicubic Sharper and that setting 
does incremental damage to images over time.

01:27: So as I say Bicubic (best for smooth gradients) 
is the safest setting, and it's also going

01:31: to serve you best when you are working with 
Smart Objects because you don't have immediate

01:34: control over the interpolation setting,
when you're scaling Smart Objects.

01:39: The next setting I want to draw your attention 
to is this one right there, Export Clipboard.

01:42: By default it's on, 
I recommend you turn it off.

01:45: Unless you're doing a lot of copying and pasting 
between different applications from Photoshop

01:50: that is to something like, I don't even know 
what Microsoft Word or something, then you

01:54: don't want Export Clipboard on because what 
ends up happening is Photoshop lets you copy

01:59: these gargantuan images and then when you 
switch to a different application, if Export

02:04: Clipboard is turned on, then Photoshop 
offloads that enormous image to the operating system

02:09: and that can take time, in worst-case 
scenario, it can even crash the OS.

02:13: So I recommend that one gets turned off.

02:16: This one right here is very interesting, Zoom 
Resizes Windows, I want you to leave it turned off,

02:20: but I want to show you 
what's up with that option.

02:22: I am going to go ahead and click OK to accept 
those couple of changes there and I'll grab

02:27: this image and I'll drag its title tab down 
into the right a little bit, so that I end

02:31: up getting this floating window.

02:33: Now notice if I zoom out, when I am working 
with the floating window like this, by pressing

02:37: Ctrl+- or Cmd+- on the Mac, the image 
gets smaller on screen, however the size of

02:42: the window does not change and the 
same happens when you zoom in as well.

02:46: If you want the floating window to resize 
along with the image, then you press Ctrl+Alt+-

02:51: or Cmd+Opt+- on the Mac and if you 
want to zoom in and resize the window,

02:55: you will press Ctrl+Alt++ 
or Cmd+Opt++ on the Mac.

02:59: And then of course, if you don't want the 
window to float anymore, you don't click on

03:02: the maximize button or anything along those 
lines because that will go ahead and cover

03:06: up the entire interface, so I'll go ahead 
and click on the restore button in order to

03:10: make the window smaller again.

03:12: Instead, what you do is you go ahead and drag 
the title bar up into the left until you see

03:15: that blue rectangle around the entire screen, 
and then you drop it into place. All right.

03:20: One final option I want to draw your attention to, 
I'll press Ctrl+K or Cmd+K on the Mac

03:24: in order to bring up the Preferences dialog 
box and then notice down here at the bottom,

03:28: there is this button that says Reset All 
Warning Dialogs, the idea is let's say at some point

03:33: in time, you have seen enough of the dialog box 
so you turn on the Don't Show Again checkbox

03:37: and then the dialog box no 
longer comes up on screen.

03:40: If you regret that decision and you want to 
see all the alert messages once again,

03:45: you click on that button and they will all come 
back and then you can again decide which ones

03:49: you want to turn off and which ones 
you want to keep on. All right.

03:52: That takes care of most of the important options here 
inside the General panel of the Preferences dialog box.

03:57: There is just one remaining which is the HUD 
Color Picker and I'll show you how that works

04:01: in the next movie.


 ** Using the visual HUD color picker

00:00: In this movie I'll introduce you to the 
Heads Up Display Color Picker or HUD Color Picker

00:04: for short, which allows you to select a color visually 
as opposed to dialing in values in the Color panel.

00:10: Now you can change its behavior from the Preferences 
dialog box, but first, let me show you how it works.

00:15: I'll go ahead and cancel out of here.

00:17: You can get to the HUD Color Picker when any 
tool except for a Selection tool is active.

00:21: An ideal candidate is the Brush tool, so 
I'll go ahead and select it, and then you have

00:26: two very different keyboard shortcuts depending 
on whether you're working on a Mac or the PC.

00:31: On the PC you press Shift+Alt and you right-click 
inside of the Image window, and then you can

00:37: go ahead and release the keys by the way, 
as long as you keep your mouse button down.

00:41: And now at this point you can go ahead and 
drag inside of this strip in order to define

00:46: a Hue value, then move over to the color field 
and drag horizontally to change the Saturation,

00:52: or vertically, to change the Luminance.

00:55: If you're working on a Mac, you want to 
press the Cmd+Ctrl+Opt keys and just click,

01:00: you don't right-click.

01:01: So you just press those three keys right in 
a row and then you click and drag inside of

01:06: your Image window, again, using 
any tool, except a Selection tool.

01:10: Now this field and strip, that's the default 
configuration for the HUD Color Picker,

01:14: but you can change it from the 
Preferences dialog box.

01:17: So I'll go ahead and press Ctrl+K or Cmd+K 
on the Mac and then I am going to switch the

01:22: Color Picker from Hue Strip (Small) and you can 
experiment with these other options if you like.

01:27: But my favorite is the standard Hue Wheel.

01:30: So I will go ahead and select 
that option and then click OK.

01:33: And now notice, if I press the Shift+Alt keys 
and right-click, that would be Cmd+Ctrl+Opt

01:39: click on the Mac.

01:40: I can drag around this wheel in order to change 
the Hue value and then I can drag inside the field,

01:46: either horizontally to change the Saturation level, 
or up and down to change the Luminance,

01:52: and then when you get the color you 
like, just release the mouse button.

01:56: And that's how you work with the Heads Up 
Display Color Picker, here inside Photoshop.


 ** The interface and performance settings

00:00: In this movie, I'll introduce you to a 
handful of interface and performance settings that

00:04: I find to be very useful.

00:06: To demonstrate the first of them I'll go ahead 
and drag this image up and to the left so that

00:10: you can see that we have this slight drop 
shadow under the image, out here in the spaceport.

00:16: To better see it, I'll light up the interface 
by pressing Shift+F2 a couple times and now

00:21: you can see that drop shadow more clearly.

00:23: Now in my opinion, there's really no purpose 
behind the drop shadow behind the image and

00:27: you can get rid of it by pressing Ctrl+K or 
Command+K on the Mac and then pressing Ctrl+2

00:32: or Cmd+2 to advance 
to the Interface items.

00:36: And notice that the Border is set to Drop 
Shadow and both the Standard Screen mode

00:40: and the Full Screen with menu mode.

00:42: I personally go ahead and turn it off for 
Full Screen with menus and leave it on for

00:46: the Standard Screen mode and that way I can 
easily tell which mode I am working with at

00:50: any given moment in time.

00:52: So now if I click OK, we'll still see the drop 
shadow because we're working in the Standard mode.

00:57: But if I press the F key to advance to the 
Full Screen mode, the drop shadow disappears.

01:01: All right, I am going to go ahead and press Shift+F1 
a couple of times to restore the dark interface.

01:07: And I'll press Ctrl+K or Cmd+K again to 
bring up Preferences and this time I'm going

01:12: to switch forward to Performance which you 
can also get by pressing Ctrl+4 or Cmd+4.

01:17: Notice our Scratch Disks down here.

01:19: The idea is, pretty much no matter what, 
whether you've got a ton of RAM installed on your

01:24: machine or just a gig say, at some point, 
Photoshop is going to top out and it's going

01:29: to have to cache some of the data that's 
associated with the open images whether it's layers,

01:34: Smart Objects, History or what have you.

01:36: It's going to have to store that 
information on the hard drive.

01:39: And that's what's meant by Scratch Disks here.

01:41: Now notice by default only the 
system-level disc is selected.

01:45: If your computer includes multiple disks what 
you want to do is turn on your biggest disk,

01:50: in my case that would be my D drive and then 
go ahead and select that disk and nudge it

01:55: up the stack, like so.

01:57: So now Photoshop is going to hit the D drive 
first and then the C drive and that's going

02:01: to make for a speedier experience.

02:03: Now in order for this option to take effect by the 
way, you're going to have to restart Photoshop.

02:07: All right, now I'll go ahead and advance to 
Cursors, and you can see that we have these

02:12: Precise Cursor options, both for the 
Painting Cursors and for the Other Cursors.

02:17: Another way to see those Precise Cursors which 
usually involve a crosshair is to just turn

02:21: on the Caps Lock key anytime you're working 
in Photoshop and then you turn Caps Lock off

02:26: to switch back to a normal 
brush tip or the standard cursor.

02:30: So I don't recommend you change these options 
up here, I do however recommend that you turn

02:34: on Show Crosshair in Brush Tip, so that you 
can see the center of your brush as you work.

02:40: Next, I am going to switchover to Units and 
Rulers and I'll show you by default Rulers

02:44: are set to inches here in the states.

02:46: I very much disapprove of that by 
the way and I'll show you why.

02:50: I am going to go ahead and click the OK button in 
order to accept the changes I've made so far.

02:55: Let's say that I want to turn this horse 
into a Facebook cover, just by way of example.

03:01: I know that a Facebook cover measures 
851 pixels wide by 315 pixels tall.

03:07: However, if I go up to the Image menu and 
choose the Canvas Size command, let's say,

03:11: in order to crop the image to exactly that 
size, by default I am going to see Inches

03:16: instead which doesn't do 
me any good whatsoever.

03:18: In fact, Inches only come in handy, 
and this goes for millimeters as well.

03:22: The only time that comes in handy 
is when you're printing an image.

03:26: And you always see inches or millimeters in 
the Image Size dialog box, and in the Print

03:31: dialog box, which are the two primary 
times you want to see those units of measure.

03:36: Otherwise we'd really want to switchover to 
Pixels and then of course, I would go ahead

03:40: and dial in those pixel values I was just telling 
you and that would crop the image to that size.

03:45: Now if I click OK at this point, Photoshop is 
going to warn me that potentially something

03:49: might get clipped inside my image, that only 
goes for the background, it doesn't affect

03:53: the layers, so in fact I'm just hiding the 
pixels, I am not cropping them for good.

03:58: So I'll just go ahead and click on the Proceed 
button and then I could press let's say Ctrl+Alt+A

04:03: or Cmd+Opt+A on the Mac to select all of 
the layers and I could Ctrl+Drag or Cmd+Drag

04:08: them to a different location to establish 
the position of my horse inside of the new

04:13: cover dimensions.

04:15: Now I'll just go ahead and zoom in 
so I can see the image at a 100%.

04:18: Now this whole experience would be made a 
lot easier if I were working with pixels,

04:22: which is the unit of measure 
I prefer inside Photoshop.

04:25: And there is a couple of 
different ways to switch over to pixels.

04:28: One is to go back to the Preferences dialog 
box, another is just to bring up the Rulers

04:32: by pressing Cmd+R or Ctrl+R and then right-click 
on a ruler and choose the desired unit of

04:38: measure, and notice you can switch 
back and forth as much as you like here.

04:42: Or just so you know everything that's available 
to you, you can go up to the Window menu and

04:46: choose the Info command, and that will bring 
up the Info panel and you'll see right here

04:51: next to the X and Y values, you'll see this 
crosshair with a little tiny arrow below it.

04:56: If you click on the crosshair, then you'll 
get the pop-up menu of units and then you

05:00: can go ahead and switch to Pixels.

05:02: And now notice that changes the ruler, it's 
also going to change the default unit of measure

05:06: inside the Canvas Size 
dialog box and elsewhere.

05:09: All right, having made all my changes to the 
preference settings, the next thing you want

05:13: to do to make sure those settings are saved is, 
on a PC go to the File menu, and choose

05:18: the Exit command, on a Mac you would go to the 
Photoshop menu and choose the Quit command.

05:22: Or of course you can press 
Ctrl+Q or Cmd+Q on a Mac.

05:26: And that takes care of the key 
preference settings here inside Photoshop.


 ** Adjusting the color settings in Photoshop

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to adjust your 
color settings to achieve what is generally

00:04: the optimal experience inside Photoshop.

00:06: Now, conceptually this is a challenging topic, 
however, the change itself is very easy to apply.

00:13: Inside of a lesser application Photoshop would 
just go ahead and send off this RGB data to

00:18: your monitor and your monitor would display 
it according to its factory default settings,

00:23: which means that the image would 
vary from one monitor to the next.

00:27: And you have probably seen this experience 
if you've ever gone into an electronic store

00:31: and seen a bunch of televisions right next to 
each other, and you have noticed for example

00:35: how the grass in the sport scene, let's say, 
up here is greenish or even yellowish on one

00:41: screen, and more bluish on another screen.

00:43: And that's what happens if 
there's no color management.

00:46: Photoshop, however, goes ahead and manages the color 
experience by assigning a profile to your RGB space.

00:54: Now if you take a look at this Title Bar up 
here at the top of the screen, you'll notice

00:57: in parentheses it says (Background) that's 
because the background is selected here inside

01:01: the Layers panel.

01:02: We are working with an RGB 
image, so Red, Green, and Blue.

01:06: The /8 tells us that the bit-depth is 8 bits 
per pixel per channel and that defines how

01:11: much distinction we have 
in the luminance range.

01:14: And then finally we are 
seeing an Asterisk (*).

01:16: Now an asterisk outside the parentheses tells 
us that we have unsaved changes, but if it's

01:21: inside the parentheses, that tells us that 
this image subscribes to a color profile that

01:26: is different than the one that Photoshop is 
using by default, which is not a problem,

01:30: by the way, that's perfectly okay, it's not 
going to cause you any problems whatsoever,

01:34: and in fact, it's a good thing that there 
is a profile assigned to this image.

01:38: So again, it doesn't vary 
from one screen to the next.

01:41: The problem is that the profile that's assigned 
by default to Photoshop is not the ideal RGB

01:47: profile, so here's what you do to change it.

01:49: You go out to the Edit menu and you choose the 
Color Settings command, or you press Ctrl+Shift+K

01:55: or Cmd+Shift+K on the Mac.

01:57: And then notice right here, by default here in 
the States, Settings is set to North American

02:02: General Purpose 2, which means 
that the RGB working space is sRGB.

02:08: Now well, sRGB is not a terrible space, 
I don't want to over-characterize this,

02:13: it's not an ideal space, it's a very old profile 
definition and it's based pretty much on a

02:18: worst case scenario computer monitor, the 
kind of thing you might have used on a PC

02:22: back in the 1990s.

02:24: Now, it's considered the ideal color space 
for the Web and I'll come back to that in

02:28: a moment, but I recommend you change it, whether 
you're creating Web graphics or print graphics

02:33: to a better space, which is this 
one right here, Adobe RGB (1998).

02:38: Now the only reason to use some other space 
such as ProPhoto RGB, is if you're typically

02:43: working with 16-bit per channel images, and if 
you are, you know who you are, but otherwise

02:49: for day-to-day work inside Photoshop, 
Adobe RGB (1998) is the best way to go.

02:55: And that's really the only 
change you need to make.

02:57: Now if you are working with a specific commercial 
printer, you may be able to get a CMYK profile

03:02: from them, so that you can achieve 
the best commercial printing results.

03:06: But you need to talk to your commercial printer 
about that, if you don't have such a profile,

03:11: I recommend you leave this option alone.

03:13: Make sure that these color management 
policies are all set to preserve embedded profiles,

03:17: that's very important, and that 
all of these checkboxes are off.

03:21: Then what I recommend you do is go and save 
off your settings by clicking on the Save button

03:25: and what I've been calling these 
settings for years now, is Best workflow.

03:30: So I will go ahead and enter 
that as my settings name.

03:33: And then you have the option of 
entering some comments if you like.

03:36: And I have gone ahead and 
copied some text to my Clipboard.

03:39: So I will just press Ctrl+V or 
Cmd+V on the Mac to paste it in.

03:42: And for one it's where the text reads: These 
are the settings that Deke recommends in his

03:46: CS6 One-on-One courses for lynda.com.

03:49: They ensure consistent color and printing 
across all CS6 applications, and we'll come

03:53: to that in just a moment.

03:55: Then I will click OK in order to save those 
settings and I will click OK again in order

03:59: to accept my change.

04:01: And now notice up here in the Title tab, 
we're no longer seeing the Asterisk (*), because

04:04: this image was already set to 
Adobe RGB in the first place.

04:08: Now the only time you're going to see the 
image shift on screen is if it's not profiled

04:13: in the first place, and if you run into that 
by the way, if you end up opening an image

04:18: and it looks peculiar, looks different than 
you anticipated, then what you want to do

04:22: is go up to the Edit menu and choose Assign 
Profile or if you've loaded dekeKeys, I have

04:27: given you a keyboard shortcut of 
Ctrl+F2 or Cmd+F2 on the Mac.

04:31: If you get an alert message, just say OK.

04:34: And then what you want to do is go ahead 
and switch the profile for that image

04:39: back to sRGB and it will look the same 
way it did in the first place.

04:43: In my case, my image is changing on screen 
and that's because it was already set to

04:49: Adobe RGB and that's the way I want to leave it.

04:51: All right, so I am going to cancel out.

04:53: Now one of the questions I frequently get 
from Web folks is shouldn't I be working in

04:58: sRGB, isn't it a mistake to use Adobe RGB?

05:02: And the answer is no, Adobe RGB is going to 
serve you better over time, because sometimes

05:08: you are going to be printing your images and 
sometimes you want the best colors you can

05:11: possibly achieve, and that's what 
Adobe RGB is going to do for you.

05:16: And also know, when you go to the File menu 
and choose the Save for Web command, that

05:20: one of the options that Photoshop goes ahead 
and applies by default here is a conversion

05:25: to sRGB, leave that checkbox on 
and everything is going go great.

05:30: Your image will look exactly the way it's 
supposed to look inside of a Web browser.

05:34: All right, I am going to go 
ahead and cancel out of here.

05:37: Now there is just one more change that you 
need to make if you own the entire Creative Suite,

05:41: this doesn't apply to those of you who 
own Photoshop by itself, but if you have

05:47: one of the many variations on the Creative Suite, 
then you want to go up to the File menu

05:50: and choose Browse in Bridge or press 
Ctrl+Alt+O or Cmd+Opt+O on the Mac

05:55: and then here inside Bridge, you go up to the Edit 
menu and choose Creative Suite Color Settings.

06:01: Now if you do not see this command, or it does 
not work for you, it means that for whatever

06:06: reason, Bridge is not recognizing 
that you own the entire Creative Suite.

06:10: I am going to go ahead and choose the command,
because it's going to work fine for me and

06:14: then you want to select those settings you 
just saved, in my case Best workflow and then

06:18: go ahead and click on the Apply button and 
that's going to apply those changes across

06:22: all the other Creative Suite applications.

06:25: Now note by the way, if you go up to the Edit 
menu and choose the command again, you are

06:29: going to see the word Synchronized at the 
top of the dialog box, which tells you that

06:33: all the Creative Suite applications are now 
set the same way, and that's very important,

06:37: because that way you won't have any color 
shifting when you're switching images back

06:41: and forth between say Photoshop and 
Illustrator or Photoshop and InDesign and so forth.

06:47: Anyway, my deed is done, so I am going to 
click the Cancel button in order to cancel

06:51: out of that dialog box and that wraps up our 
look at advanced shortcuts and settings, here

06:56: inside Photoshop and Bridge.

 ** Smart Objects

00:00: The topic of the chapter is Smart Objects.

00:03: To truly understand how they work.

00:05: You need to know two things about them; 
they aren't smart and they're not objects.

00:10: But you know otherwise 
they make perfect sense.

00:13: What they're indestructible envelopes.

00:15: You put one or more layers into 
a Smart Object the envelope.

00:19: And from that point on those 
layers are impervious to damage.

00:23: Seriously, unless you break the seal on the 
envelope and edit the layers directly,

00:27: you can not hurt them, which mean that you can 
scale and rotate them as much as you want.

00:32: You can pummel them with effects and the 
Filter menu in the pixels go unharmed.

00:37: And just for fun you can clone them.

00:39: Make as many copies as you like,

00:41: all linked to a single original.

00:43: In this chapter I'll demonstrate Smart Objects 
in the context of a vector graphic created

00:48: in Adobe Illustrator. We'll place a graphic into a 
photograph which automatically makes a Smart Object.

00:55: They will turn it into a photo realistic tattoo by 
warping around this dude's great swollen bicep,

01:02: applying some blending options and Blur in 
it with a Smart Filter to disperse the ink.

01:07: Finally, we'll launch Illustrator from inside 
Photoshop, modify the graphic and save the changes

01:13: back into Photoshop.

01:15: In the final movie I'll show you a special 
trick available only in Photoshop Extended.

01:21: That lets you remove all 
people from a photograph.

01:23: And it works great, too.

01:25: Of course they're not gone 
forever are just hidden.

01:28: Because nothing at the Hulk could not Voldemort 
not even Donkey Kong can hurt a Smart Object.


 ** Three ways to place a Smart Object

00:00: In this movie I'll show you three ways to place 
art work as a Smart Object inside Photoshop.

00:05: And even though I'll be demonstrating these 
methods using an Illustrator file,

00:09: things were just the same when you're 
placing a photographic image as well.

00:13: Over the course of this project we're going 
to take this guy with this big meaty bicep

00:16: and we're going to give him a tattoo.

00:18: And even though this is a piece of vector-based 
artwork from Illustrator, it integrates seamlessly

00:24: along with the photographic image.

00:26: So let's see how things work here.

00:28: Method number one is to go up to the 
File menu and choose the Place command.

00:31: And if you loaded my dekeKeys you'll notice 
that you have a keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+Alt+D

00:36: or Cmd+Option+D be on the Mac.

00:38: Then navigate your way to the 24_smart_objects 
folder and therein you will find, among other

00:43: files, you'll find many more files here.

00:45: But you'll find one called Tiger tattoo.ai, 
go ahead and click on the Place button

00:49: in order to load it on up.

00:51: Next you'll see the Place PDF dialog box and 
incidentally, if you're saying a smaller version

00:56: of the artwork then you can switch the 
Thumbnail Size from Small to Fit Page.

01:01: Now what this is telling us is that Photoshop 
requires a PDF definition of the artwork in

01:05: order to place it, but that's just fine because 
Illustrator goes ahead and saves PDF definitions

01:11: of its artwork by default.

01:13: Next go ahead and click OK to load out the 
artwork, at first it's going to appear jagged

01:17: and that's just a 
function of the Place preview.

01:19: Now at this point you may want to scale your 
artwork and I am going to do so by clicking

01:24: on this Link icon up here in the Options bar,
then I am going to change the Width value

01:28: to 50%, which changes the 
Height to 50% as well.

01:31: Notice that still looks jagged, but if you 
press the Enter key or the Return key on a

01:35: Mac a couple of times, in order to complete 
the Place operation Photoshop goes ahead and

01:40: renders out the vector-based 
artwork to smooth pixels.

01:43: Now notice over here in the Layers panel that 
we do indeed have a Smart Object as indicated

01:47: by this little page icon in the 
lower right corner of the thumbnail.

01:51: Okay, so that's one way to work.

01:53: I am going to press the Backspace key or the 
Delete key on the Mac to get rid of that layer.

01:57: The second method for placing a Smart Object 
is to go up to the File menu and choose

02:01: Browse in Mini Bridge and that'll bring up the Mini Bridge, 
by default down here at the bottom of the screen.

02:06: Once again navigate your way to the smart_objects 
folder inside the exercise_files folder,

02:11: find the Tiger tattoo.ai file and just go ahead 
and drag it and drop it into the image.

02:16: Once again that produces a Place PDF dialog box,
you click OK and then you press the

02:21: Enter key or the Return key on a 
Mac to render out the artwork.

02:24: All right, I am going to go ahead and hide 
the Mini Bridge by double-clicking on its

02:27: tab and then I'll once again press the 
Backspace key or the Delete key on a Mac.

02:31: Your final method is to go ahead and bring 
up the folder at the Desktop level of your

02:35: computer and that's going to be the 
Explorer here on the PC or the Finder on the Mac.

02:40: Find that Tiger tattoo.ai file and just go 
ahead and drag it and drop it into the Image

02:45: window in the background.

02:46: Again you'll see that same Place PDF dialog 
box, just go ahead and click OK, and

02:51: if you like, go ahead and scale the 
artwork as well as I'm doing here.

02:55: And those are the three ways to place any 
artwork whether it's a photographic-based

03:00: image or a piece of vector-based artwork 
like this as a Smart Object inside Photoshop.


 ** Copying and pasting from Adobe Illustrator

00:00: In this movie I'll show you yet another way 
to bring artwork into Photoshop as a Smart Object,

00:04: but this specific method works only 
with vector-based artwork created inside of

00:09: Illustrator and it's really as simple as 
copying from one program and pasting into the other,

00:13: but you have a handful of 
options when pasting the artwork.

00:17: So here I am working inside of Illustrator 
and I've got open the Tiger tattoo.ai file,

00:22: I'm going to go up to the Select menu and 
choose the All command or you can press Ctrl+A

00:26: or Cmd+A on the Mac and then go up to 
the Edit menu and choose the Copy command

00:31: or press Ctrl+C here on a 
PC or Cmd+C on the Mac.

00:35: Then I'll switch over to Photoshop which is 
running in the background here and I'll go up

00:39: to the Edit menu and choose Paste or I can 
press Ctrl+V or Cmd+V on the Mac and then

00:45: Photoshop will ask me how I want to paste this 
artwork. Now I should say if you're bringing

00:49: vector-based artwork in from another application, 
let say InDesign then it'll just go ahead

00:54: and paste this as a Smart Object by default, but when 
you're working with Illustrator you've got choices.

01:00: For example, I could select Pixels 
if I wanted to paste a pixel-based layer.

01:04: Now the only reason you do that is if something 
went wrong with the Smart Object paste, otherwise

01:10: you want to steer clear of that option, 
because it efforts you a lot less flexibility,

01:14: you can also paste Path outlines if you want to 
and those outlines will appear in the Paths panel

01:19: and we'll visit Paths in more detail 
when we look at the Pen tool in the future

01:23: chapter inside this course.

01:26: And then your last option is to paste to Shape 
Layer and I'm going to go ahead and do that

01:30: for now, so I can show you how things have 
improved inside CS6, so I'll go ahead and

01:34: click OK and we end up with a 
new shape layer called Shape 1.

01:38: Now you may recall that our Illustrator artwork 
included strokes and those have gotten lost

01:43: in the translation, so all we have our path 
outlines filled with the foreground color

01:48: in my case black, but I can reinstate those 
strokes if I want to by switching to my black

01:52: Arrow tool which I can get by pressing the 
A key and then I'll have access to my

01:56: Stroke options up here in the options bar.

01:59: I'm going to start by clicking in the Stroke 
swatch and then I'll click on this little

02:02: colorful icon to bring up to a Color Picker 
dialog box and I'll change the R value to 150

02:07: and then I'll click OK and I'll also 
change the width of the stroke to 1 point in the

02:14: case of this artwork and I'm going to have 
to modify where that stroke sits, so I'll

02:18: click on this little line icon then I'll click 
on More Options and I'll change my Align setting

02:24: to Outside and you may notice in the 
background that introduces an error, but if I switch

02:29: to Corners from Mitre to Round than that little 
anomaly goes away, right now click OK in order

02:34: to accept that change and I'll also press the Enter 
key or the Return key on the Mac to hide that

02:39: panel and I might will press Ctrl+H or 
Cmd+H on a Mac to hide those shape outlines.

02:44: Problem is even though I can build back a certain amount 
of the fills and strokes associated with this tiger.

02:50: A shape layer can contain just one fill and 
my originals Illustration had a black fill

02:56: inside the Tigers face and then some gradients 
inside of these flames on the far left and

03:01: right sides and that is not something I can 
achieve without creating a separate shape layer.

03:07: So really the best way to work where this 
artwork is concerned is to bring it in this

03:11: Smart Object, so I'm going to press the 
Backspace key or the Delete key on the Mac to

03:15: get rid of that layer and I'll press Ctrl+V or 
Cmd+V on a Mac in order to invoke the Paste command

03:20: and I'll select Smart Object and click OK 
and then I'll go through the same ritual

03:25: as before, I'll go ahead and turn on link icon 
up here in the options bar and I'll change

03:30: the Width value to 50% and that will change 
the height value to 50% as well then

03:34: I'll press the Enter key or the Return key on 
the Mac a couple of times in order to create that

03:39: Smart Object layer.

03:41: Now an additional advantage to working with 
this Smart Object is that we can transform

03:45: this layer as much as we want and we'll keep 
track of the transformations as we go as opposed

03:51: to having the transformed values reset as 
happens when you apply multiple transformations

03:56: to a vector based shape player.

03:58: So where this specific artwork is concerned, 
a Smart Object is by far the best solution.

04:04: In the next movie we'll begin warping and 
transforming this layer in order to fit around

04:09: this fellow's bicep.


 ** Transforming and warping a vector object

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to transform 
and warp this vector-based Smart Object

00:04: around the contours of this fellow's arm.

00:06: Notice that my Smart Object is 
selected here in the Layers panel.

00:09: I'm going to go ahead and rename it Tiger 
tattoo because that's what it's going to

00:13: be and then just to get my bearings.

00:15: I'm going to go up to the Edit menu and choose 
the Transform command and notice here in the

00:20: submenu, that we can scale rotate and skew 
this layer, but we can't apply the distort

00:25: perspective or warp effects.

00:28: Now that doesn't have anything to do with 
the fact that this layer is a Smart Object,

00:31: it has everything to do with the fact that 
it came from Illustrator, but there's a very

00:35: simple if not particularly obvious solution 
and that is to go ahead and select that layer,

00:40: then go up to Layer panel flyout menu and 
choose Convert to Smart Object again even

00:45: though it's already a Smart Object, we're going 
to place it inside of another Smart Object.

00:50: If you loaded my dekeKey shortcuts I've given you a 
keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+, or Cmd+, on the Mac.

00:57: Now if we go up to the Edit menu, and choose Transform,
you'll see that all of the options are available.

01:03: Now we want to apply them in one operation 
using the Free Transform command, so I'll

01:08: go ahead and choose the command or press 
Ctrl+T or Cmd+T on the Mac, and I'm going to

01:12: start off by scaling and rotating the artwork and 
these are the values I just happened to come up with.

01:18: I'm going to change the width value to 64% 
and the height to 82%, because I reasoned

01:23: that once this artwork was tattooed on this 
guy's arm, it would end up stretching vertically

01:28: and now I'm going to change the angle value to 
18 degrees and if your values end up changing

01:32: any just little bit, it's not the end of the 
world, it's not actually going to affect the

01:36: quality of the final image.

01:38: Now I'm going to warp the artwork, and I'll 
do so by clicking on the Warp icon over here

01:42: on the right side of the options bar and 
I started things out by setting the warp style

01:46: to Arch and then I went ahead and bent this 
tiger just by dragging this top anchor point

01:53: there, but while that works well for wrapping 
the tiger around the sort of volumetric cylinder

01:59: like shape of his arm, we're not tracing the 
actual bulges that is the way the bicep bulges

02:05: and the way the shoulder goes in 
and then back out and so forth.

02:08: So while arch is a good starting point, I'm 
going to switch over to custom, so that I gain

02:13: access to these corner handles as well as 
these levers, so I'm going to move this handle

02:19: up to about this location here, and then I'll 
drag this lever out like so and notice that

02:24: that's stretching at the artwork and then 
I'll go ahead and move this top right-handle

02:28: up a little bit, and I'll drag this lever 
up and over as well, so that we're twisting

02:34: the tattoo pretty heavily into the shoulder, 
and I found that exaggerating the effect helped

02:39: a lot, because that ends up showing that the 
artwork is actually contouring to the shape

02:43: of his guy's arm.

02:44: All right I'm going to drag this guy down, 
maybe drag this anchor point up a little bit

02:48: like so take the lever up as well take this lever 
over to about this location should work out.

02:55: I'll drag the corner handle to here move 
this lever up so that we have a little more

03:00: bend at the bottom, take this 
guy up quite a bit as well.

03:03: Now I really want to do exaggerate the bulge 
of the arm there, and then I'll grab this

03:07: lever and take it up and, by the way, you can 
also drag directly on the image if you like.

03:13: So in this case I'm dragging on the tiger's 
face in order to lift that central face area upward,

03:18: and that's pretty much the effect 
I'm looking for. And don't worry about the

03:22: fact that the flames are extending beyond 
the edge of the arm, we'll take care of that later.

03:25: Go ahead and press the Enter key or 
the Return key on the Mac in order to exit

03:30: the Free Transform mode and apply 
that warp effect to your artwork.

03:33: And by the way, because we're working with the 
Smart Object, you can always change your mind.

03:37: If you want to make a few adjustments just 
press Ctrl+T or Cmd+T to once again enter

03:42: the Free Transform mode, go ahead and click 
on that Warp icon in order to switch to the

03:47: Warp mode and then go ahead and drag at any 
point in the artwork you like in order to

03:52: further stretch it.

03:53: So I might go ahead and drag up on his chin 
for example in order to lifted upwards just

03:58: a little bit as well and then I'll press the 
Enter key or the Return key on the Mac,

04:02: to accept my latest modifications.

04:04: And you know what, I have to say that his 
eyes are looking little crooked, it looks

04:08: like his face is bending right there don't 
like that, so again I'll just press Ctrl+T,

04:12: Cmd+T on the Mac to enter free transform 
mode, go ahead and click on a Warp icon and

04:17: then I'm just going to drag his 
face down a little bit like so.

04:21: I think that might end up looking a little 
better, and maybe take this lever up as well

04:25: to raise that left eye and that looks 
like that should work pretty well.

04:29: So I'll press the Enter key or the Return 
key on the Mac in order to apply yet another

04:33: heaping, helping of Warp, so you can do that as 
much as you want and you'll get nondestructive

04:38: results as long as you're working with a Smart 
Object combined in this case with vector-based

04:44: artwork here inside Photoshop.


 ** Blending a Smart Object into a photograph

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to blend the 
tattoo in with the flesh of the arm and

00:04: I'll also show you how to blend away these little 
bits of flame that are extending beyond the arm,

00:08: and this will serve as a kind of advance 
preview the sort of blending options

00:12: that we'll see in a future chapter.

00:14: So for starters here, you want to double-click 
on an empty portion of this layer here inside

00:19: the Layers panel, in order to open up the 
layer Style dialog box, I'm going to go ahead

00:23: and move this dialog box off screen and also 
zoom into the artwork by Ctrl+Spacebar or

00:29: Cmd+Spacebar clicking.

00:31: Now notice this slider bar that's labeled 
underlying layer, it extends from black over here

00:35: on the left-hand side to white over on 
the right-hand side and we also have

00:40: luminance values of 0 for black and 255 for white.

00:44: What we can do by modifying these slider triangles 
is force through luminance levels from the

00:50: underlying layer so that they become visible 
and the pixels on the active layer on top

00:54: of them become invisible.

00:56: So notice if I drag this white triangle over 
to the left, let's say to somewhere around 150,

01:01: I'm saying anything in the arm with a 
luminance level of a 150 or brighter is going

01:07: to force its way through.

01:09: As a result, we end up having some pretty 
choppy transitions as you can see here,

01:14: so the pixels just die away, they're either visible 
of those portions of the arm are 150 or darker

01:19: or they're invisible if 
the arm is 150 or lighter.

01:23: The good news is that we've gone ahead and 
dropped away the flames on the outside of the arm.

01:28: So where as previously, the flames were extending 
into that white background as soon as we moved

01:33: that white triangle just a little bit 
over to the left those flames disappear.

01:37: If you want to achieve smooth transitions, 
so that the pixels gradually drop away,

01:43: then you want to press the Alt key or the 
Opt key on a Mac and notice that we have this

01:46: little sliver in the middle of the triangle.

01:49: That's showing us that it's really two triangles 
that have been merged together and if you

01:53: Alt+Drag or Opt+Drag the left half of that 
triangle you'll go ahead and pull it apart,

01:58: and I'm going to take it down to a value of 
a 100, like so, so that we can clearly

02:03: see some of the flesh in the arm and then 
I'll go ahead and move the right side of that

02:08: white triangle back up to 250.

02:10: And so what we're seeing in this case is 
anywhere where the arm is 250 or brighter the pixels

02:16: completely disappear anywhere where it's a 
hundred or darker, the pixels on the tiger

02:21: tattoo layer are all together visible and 
anywhere in between they're gradually disappearing.

02:27: So we get an affect that makes it look like 
the tattoo is really painted onto that flesh.

02:32: The next thing you want to do is change the 
Blend mode from Normal to Multiply, so that

02:36: you get a uniform darkening effect and 
that's just going to go ahead and sink those red

02:40: strokes into the skin and then you want to 
click OK in order to accept that change.

02:46: So to get a sense of what we've been able to 
accomplish, I'll press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z

02:49: on a Mac to restore the opaque version of 
the tattoo, so that's what it looked like

02:54: before obviously a synthetic piece of artwork 
just slapped on top of the image and now if

02:59: I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z again, we get a 
tattoo that looks like it's really emblazoned

03:04: onto the skin and therefore it serves 
as a credible element of this composition.


 ** Blurring with a nested Smart Filter

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to blur the 
tiger tattoo with the application of a Smart Filter,

00:04: and I'll show you how to blend that 
filter into place as well and then I'll show

00:08: you a special approach that will allow us 
to see the effects of the Smart Filter even

00:13: if we apply further transformations.

00:16: So I'm going to start things off here by going 
up to the Filter menu and choosing Blur

00:20: and then I'll choose Gaussian Blur and if you 
loaded dekeKeys you've got a keyboard shortcut,

00:24: this is a very common useful filter, of 
Shift+F6. And I ultimately elected to set the

00:29: Radius value to 4 pixels where this image is 
concerned, higher resolution images incidentally

00:35: would require a higher radius values in order 
to achieve the same effect, and then

00:39: I'll go ahead and click OK 
in order to apply that filter.

00:43: Because I'm working with a Smart Object, Photoshop 
applies Gaussian Blur automatically as a

00:48: Smart Filter, which means that I 
can edit it anytime I like.

00:51: Now all I have to do to edit the settings 
is double-click on the words Gaussian Blur

00:56: and then I have access to 
that radius value once again.

00:59: Anyway, for now I'm just going to cancel out.

01:01: Now let's say at this point, this isn't really 
the effect I want, it's way to blurry, but we'll

01:05: address that in a moment, but for now let's 
imagine that I want to apply further transformations

01:11: to this image and I want to be able to see 
the filtered version of the image as well.

01:16: Well, if you go up to the Edit menu, and choose 
Free Transform or any of the other transformation

01:21: options, then Photoshop is going to warn you 
that the Smart Filters that are applied to

01:25: this layer will be turned off temporarily, so 
as long as you're applying the transformation,

01:30: you can't see the filter and sure enough when 
I click OK, the Gaussian Blur effect disappears.

01:35: What if that's not what you want?

01:36: Well, I'm going to go ahead and press the Escape 
key in order to leave the Free Transform mode

01:41: and then I'll right-click on the words 
Smart Filters and choose Clear Smart Filters

01:46: in order to get rid of that effect.

01:49: The great thing here is we've got a Smart 
Object inside of a Smart Object, so we can

01:53: nest the filtering effect like so, just go 
ahead and double-click on the thumbnail for

01:57: the tiger tattoo layer.

01:59: If you get this alert message that's telling 
you how Smart Filters work just go ahead and

02:03: click OK and then inside the Smart Object,
we're still in Photoshop by the way,

02:08: you want to go up to the Filter menu and just 
choose that first command or you can press

02:12: Ctrl+F or Cmd+F on the Mac and because 
we're working with the Smart Object, as you

02:16: can see here, Photoshop goes ahead and forces 
the display of the Gaussian Blur dialog box.

02:21: I still want to apply a radius values 4 pixels 
then I'll click OK and I also want to go ahead

02:27: and blend this filtering effect into the original 
image and I'm going to do that by double-clicking

02:32: on this little slider icon there and that'll 
bring up the Blending Options dialog box and

02:37: I'm going to change the mode from Normal, once 
again, to Multiply in order to sync that affect.

02:43: So what I am doing is I am telling Photoshop 
to use the Gaussian Blur exclusively to darken

02:47: the image, which means that the blur is going 
outward and not inward and that will create

02:52: the appearance of the any kind of leaching 
into the skin and then I'll select the Opacity

02:57: value and change it to 75% and I'll click OK.

03:01: Now because the Gaussian Blur effect is 
extending outside the outlines of this tiger art,

03:06: it's extending outside of the canvas as well, so 
we're going to get some very sharp edges if

03:11: we just go and save our changes at this point.

03:13: What we need to do is 
extend the canvas a little bit.

03:16: By going up to the Image menu, and choosing the 
Canvas Size command or you can press Ctrl+Alt+C

03:20: or Cmd+Opt+C on the Mac, and I'm going to 
turn on the relative checkbox, so that

03:25: we're just adding pixels to the image and 
I'm going to enter a width value of 20 pixels

03:29: and a height value of 20 pixels as well and I'm just 
trying to give it way more pixels than we need.

03:35: Theoretically, because of the Gaussian 
distribution of the Gaussian Blur filter we need about

03:41: 6 or 7 pixels in order to account for 4 pixels 
of radius but 20 pixels will for sure be enough.

03:48: Now I'll go ahead and click OK in 
order to extend that canvas outward.

03:52: Now that I'm done working on the Smart Object 
I'll go ahead and close it and then here on

03:56: a PC I'll click the Yes button on the Mac 
you'll click the Save button in order to update

04:01: that Smart Object inside 
of the larger composition.

04:04: Now that we've applied the filter inside of 
the Smart Object, instead of outside of it

04:10: we can transform this layer and still see 
the effect of the filter and so just by way

04:15: of demonstration, I'll go up to the Edit menu 
and choose as opposed to Free Transform this time,

04:19: I'll go to the Transform submenu and 
choose the Warp Command, so we can go directly

04:24: to the Warp mode and note we don't get an 
alert message this time and we continue to

04:29: see the effects of the Gaussian Blur filter.

04:32: And then, I'm just going to drag upward on 
the flames at the top of the tiger's head

04:36: in order to add a little bit of extra distortion 
there, and when I'm done I'll press the Enter

04:41: key or the Return key on the Mac, in order 
to accept my changes and that's how you blur

04:46: an image with the help of a Smart Filter 
nested inside of a Smart Object, so that you can

04:51: continue to see the results of the filter 
even when you apply further transformations.


 ** Editing a Smart Object in Illustrator

00:00: In this movie I'll show how to modify this 
artwork inside of Illustrator and then save

00:05: the changes back to Photoshop.

00:07: When you're working with a Smart Object, 
everything about that object is embedded in

00:12: the current file. So in other words, there 
is no link between the Illustrations in the

00:16: original tigertattoo.ai file on disk.

00:20: So you were to make some changes to that file,
they would not be reflected inside of this image.

00:24: Instead, the entire Illustration is embedded 
inside of this Photoshop composition

00:31: which means that you need to edit it from 
the composition as well and here's how.

00:35: We'll start things off by double-clicking 
on the thumbnail for the tigertattoo layer

00:38: here inside the Layers panel.

00:40: If you get this alert which is just telling 
you how Smart Objects work, you will probably

00:44: want to turn on that Don't show 
again checkbox and then click OK.

00:48: Now we're looking at the nested Smart Object, 
the one that contains the Illustration itself,

00:53: to edit it go ahead and double-click on its 
thumbnail once again inside the Layers panel,

00:59: and that's going to take you into Illustrator. Notice 
that Photoshop just launched Illustrator for me.

01:04: I'm going to a head and maximize Illustrator 
so it takes up the entire screen here and

01:08: I'll press Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0 on a Mac in 
order to fit the Illustration inside the window.

01:14: Now the specific modification that I want 
to make is to fill the black portion of the

01:18: tiger's face with that same gradient that 
I've currently assigned to the flames.

01:23: Assuming that you've got the black Arrow tool 
selected at the top of the toolbox, then you

01:27: can just go a head and click anywhere on this 
black path outline and select the entire thing.

01:33: So it's essentially this very 
complicated compound path.

01:36: Now in order to match the Fill of the Flames 
you want drop down to the eye-dropper tool

01:41: which you can get by pressing the 
i key just as you do inside Photoshop.

01:45: And then click inside either the Fill Shapes. 
The only problem now is that the gradient is

01:50: at the wrong angle and you solve that problem by 
selecting the next tool up which is a Gradient tool.

01:56: And then you want to drag from the bottom of the 
tiger's chin up to the top of the flames like so.

02:01: I'm also pressing the Shift key in order to 
constrain the angle of my drag to exactly

02:05: vertical and I end up 
getting this effect here.

02:08: Now I'll go ahead and switch back to the black 
Arrow tool which it just so happens you can get

02:12: by pressing the V key and at this point, I want to 
go ahead update the artwork inside of Photoshop.

02:18: And that's as simple as it's been in past. 
You just go ahead and close the artwork and

02:22: then you click on the Yes button here 
on a PC or the Save button on the Mac.

02:27: Now it's not going to look like anything particularly 
happened because we're still inside of Illustrator.

02:32: What we need to do is switch over to Photoshop,  
and you can see as soon as we switched to

02:37: Photoshop the artwork updates automatically.

02:40: Now we need to close this Smart Object and 
click the Yes button once again, here on the

02:44: PC or the Save button on a Mac, in 
order to update the original composition.

02:50: And now of course, if you like what you get, 
you go ahead save your changes to the

02:54: Hard Drive by choosing the Save
command from the File menu.

02:57: You can also Undo a change made to a Smart 
Object even thought there was a multi-step

03:02: operation, all I've to do is press Ctrl+Z 
or Cmd+Z on the Mac to Undo the entire

03:07: thing or press Ctrl+Z or 
Cmd+Z on a Mac to invoke a redo.

03:12: And that's how you edit a vector-based Smart 
Object directly inside Illustrator and then

03:17: hand the changes back to Photoshop.


 ** Creating "true clones"

00:00: In this movie I'll introduce you to another 
feature of Smart Objects that doesn't have

00:04: a name, that is to say Adobe has never given 
it a name, which is why I call it True Clones.

00:10: And the idea is you can create several copies 
of a Smart Object and they'll all link back

00:14: to a single original.

00:16: So we're going to start with this revised 
version of the artwork, you can see that I've

00:20: switched out the Tiger's head for a more colorful 
piece of stock art, but it still a Smart Object

00:24: that links back to Adobe Illustrator, 
and I also have this layer of text.

00:28: We're going to go ahead and convert the text 
into Smart Object and copy it several times

00:32: to create this watermark pattern.

00:34: And the idea is we're including this watermark,
so if we give-away the image for free it's

00:38: not usable until somebody purchases and 
downloads an unwatermarked version of the composition.

00:44: But because I've set the watermark up using 
true clones, I can always switch out the company

00:49: name if I want to like this. And I can do so 
in just a couple of operations as we'll see.

00:55: So let's start off in 
this base composition here.

00:58: For starters I need to set up a kind of grid, 
so that I can create copies of my text layer

01:03: at regular intervals, so I'm going to press 
Ctrl+R or Cmd+R on the Mac to bring up

01:07: the rulers, and then I'll select the background  
here in the Layers panel and press Ctrl+A

01:11: or Cmd+A on the Mac in order to select 
the entire artwork and then I'll press

01:16: Ctrl+T or Cmd+T on the Mac in order 
to enter the Free Transform mode.

01:19: At which point I can see this reference point 
target right there which represents the exact

01:24: center of my artwork and now I'll drag down a 
horizontal guideline and snap it into alignment

01:29: with that target and if you end up not seeing 
your guide as I'm not seeing mine, then press

01:34: Ctrl+; or Cmd+; on a Mac in order to show 
those guides, and then I'll drag a vertical

01:40: guideline out as well and now I'll press the 
Escape key in order to escape out of the

01:44: Free Transform mode and I'll press Ctrl+D or Cmd+D
on the Mac in order to deselect my artwork.

01:50: One more thing we want to do is locate the 
origin point for the ruler right there at

01:55: that guide intersection.

01:57: So I'll drag from the upper left corner of 
the rulers and snap my cursor into alignment

02:00: with those guidelines, and now you can see the 0, 0 
point is right there at the center of the artwork.

02:06: All right, I don't need my rulers anymore, 
so I'll press Ctrl+R or Cmd+R on the Mac

02:10: to hide him, and then I'll switch to my Text 
layer and convert it to a Smart Object by

02:14: going up to Layers panel flyout menu and choosing 
Convert to Smart Object or if you loaded dekeKeys

02:19: you can press Ctrl+, or Cmd+, on the Mac.

02:22: Now in ideal world I'll be able to duplicate this 
text by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T or Cmd+Opt+T and

02:26: then step and repeat by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+T 
or Cmd+Shift+Opt+T, but unfortunately

02:32: neither of those features 
work with Smart objects.

02:35: So what I'm going to do instead is press CtrlJ 
or Cmd+J on the Mac a couple of times

02:40: in order to create copies 
of that Smart Object layer.

02:43: Then I'll click in the middle one to select 
it and I'll press Ctrl+T or Cmd+T on the Mac

02:47: in order to enter the Free Transform mode, and 
you want to make sure up here in the Options bar

02:51: that this triangle, the delta is turned off, so  
that you're seeing absolute positioning values.

02:57: And then change that Y value to 0 and press 
the Enter key or the Return key on Mac a couple

03:03: of times in order to scoot that text, so its 
center is exactly vertically aligned to the

03:07: center of the artwork.

03:09: Now click on the lowest of the Photos by 
Floyd layers and then press Ctrl+T

03:13: or Cmd+T on the Mac to once again enter the Free 
Transform mode and change that Y value from

03:18: negative to positive, so just get rid of the Minus 
(-) sign and press the Enter key or the Return

03:23: key on the Mac a couple of times 
in order to nudge that text down.

03:26: So by virtue of the fact that we're using 
the same value just a positive value instead

03:31: of the negative value it's as far below the 
center of the artwork as the original layer

03:36: is above the center of the artwork.

03:37: All right, that takes care of our first 
three true clones of our Smart Object original.

03:42: In the next movie I'll show you how to create 
the other true clones using a simple but

03:47: clever transformation trick.


 ** Duplicating a group of clones

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to create a 
second column of true clones over here the

00:03: right-hand side of the image using a 
simple but clever transformation trick.

00:08: Specifically we're going to be flipping the 
existing column of clones twice in a row.

00:13: Once to position the column over here on the 
right-hand side and then to make the text

00:16: read properly from left to right.

00:18: So first thing we need to do is select all 
these Smart Object clone layers by clicking

00:22: on one and Shift+Clicking on the other, and 
then go up to the Layers panel flyout menu

00:27: and choose New Group from layers and that'll 
force to display of this dialog box,

00:31: so we can name the group left and click OK.

00:33: All right, now I'm going to make a copy of 
this group by pressing Ctrl+J or Cmd+J

00:38: on the Mac and I'll return to the original 
group down here and rename it right, because

00:44: these layers are going to be a right-hand 
column and by virtue of the fact we've been

00:47: Ctrl+J or Cmd+J on a Mac to duplicate 
this various layers, they are all true clones

00:53: of a single original.

00:55: So I'm going to press Ctrl+T or Cmd+T on the Mac 
in order to enter the Free Transform mode

00:59: for this entire group as you can see.

01:01: And what you want to do is move this target so 
it snaps into alignment with the intersection

01:06: of the guidelines.

01:07: Now I can't get the snap to work in my case, 
and if you have that same problem,

01:12: here is an interesting trick.

01:13: After you get done selecting the target, this 
reference point right there, the values represented

01:18: up here in the Control panel now represent 
the location of not the object itself,

01:24: but rather the target, so you can change both 
the X value and the Y value to 0 in order

01:30: to make sure that that target is right there 
at the guide intersection and this presupposes

01:36: by the way that you went ahead and moved the 
origin point to align to the intersection

01:41: of the guidelines in the previous movie.

01:44: Then right-click inside of the Image window 
and choose Flip Horizontal in order to flip

01:48: that text over to the right-hand side and 
because we moved the target to the intersection

01:54: of those two guides we're flipping across 
the vertical guide like so and that creates

01:58: a second column of clones exactly where it 
needs to be and press the Enter key or the

02:03: Return key on the Mac in 
order to apply that change.

02:06: Now that not only positions the text, but it 
also flips it thereby rendering it illegible

02:11: unless of course you've got a mirror.

02:13: So press Ctrl+T or Cmd+T on the Mac to 
once again enter the Free Transform mode

02:18: and then right-click inside the Image 
window and choose Flip Horizontal.

02:22: Again this time without moving that target and 
that will go ahead and flip the text around

02:28: its own center and we get the exact effect 
we're looking for and press the Enter key

02:32: or the Return key on a Mac in 
order to accept that change.

02:35: All right, that takes care of our six true 
clones, but if you recall the final version

02:40: of the composition we're going for, I want 
these two additional layers right here to

02:45: link to a different Smart Object and I'll 
show you how to accomplish that using a command

02:50: called New Smart Object Via Copy.


 ** Breaking the Smart Object link

00:00: In this movie I will show you how to break 
the link between a copy of a Smart Object

00:03: and its original, using a command that's not 
particularly discoverable inside of Photoshop

00:08: that goes by the name of 
Smart Object via Copy.

00:12: So what I am going to do here is expand this 
right group and then click on its top layer

00:16: to make it active.

00:17: Now if you duplicate the layer by going up to 
layer menu choosing New and choosing

00:22: Layer via Copy or if you press that command's 
keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+J or Cmd+J on the Mac,

00:27: then you create yet another true clone, 
just as we have been doing in the past.

00:31: If you don't want this to be a clone, you just 
want it be a copy, then what you do is you

00:35: drop down to the Smart Objects sublayer and you 
choose this command, New Smart Object via Copy.

00:42: Now the name of the command really 
doesn't make that much sense in my opinion.

00:45: Layer Via Copy creates a true clone and Smart 
Object Via Copy ends up breaking the link,

00:51: but this is the command you want.

00:53: And if you loaded dekeKeys, you can also get to it by 
pressing Ctrl+Alt+Comma(,) or Cmd+Opt+Comma(,)

00:58: on the Mac and that will go ahead and create 
another copy of that Smart Object that doesn't

01:03: look any different.

01:04: So there is no way to tell that this 
particular layer is differently linked, other than to

01:09: just go ahead and rename it,
which is what I suggest.

01:11: And I am going to call this one file numbers, 
because that will end up being its purpose,

01:15: and then I will drag it out of the group and 
you want to make sure that you can see that

01:18: horizontal line between the 
left and right groups, like so.

01:21: And then I will go ahead and twirl the right 
group closed, and now I want to create a

01:25: true clone of this layer, so I will press Ctrl+J 
or Cmd+J on the Mac in order to do so.

01:30: So now we have two true clones linked to a 
single original, but an original that is different

01:35: than all of the other true clones.

01:37: All right, now we need to properly position 
these watermarks, and here is how to do that.

01:41: Click on the lower of the two file numbers 
layer, and then press Ctrl+T or Cmd+T

01:46: on the Mac in order to 
enter the Free Transform mode.

01:49: Now go up to the options bar click on that 
Y value and change it to 0 and then press

01:54: the Enter or the Return key on the Mac and 
that goes ahead and moves the text downward,

01:58: so it's vertically aligned 
with the center of the artwork.

02:00: All right now grab both of these guys, so 
Shift+Click on the other layer there, in order

02:05: to select it and let's create another group 
by going up to Layers panel flyout menu and

02:10: choosing New Group from layers and go ahead 
and Name this group middle this time around,

02:14: and then press the Enter or 
the Return key on the Mac.

02:17: Now we need to properly position these layers 
and you do that by pressing Ctrl+T or Cmd+T

02:21: on the Mac to once again enter the Free 
Transform mode, and go ahead and drag this bounding

02:27: box, so that its target point there, that 
reference point right there in the middle

02:31: the bounding box, snaps into alignment with 
the intersection of the two guidelines and

02:36: then press the Enter key or the Return key 
on the Mac in order to apply that change.

02:40: And now we have every single one of our 
text layers properly aligned and distributed.

02:44: In the next movie I will show you how to apply 
layer Effects to multiple layers at a time,

02:50: once again, using a Smart Object.


 ** Styling and blending Smart Objects

00:00: In this movie I will show you how to apply a 
layer Effect and a Blend Setting to multiple

00:04: layers at a time using a Smart Object.

00:06: Now this isn't your only option. As demonstrated 
inside this version of the composition,

00:11: you can go ahead and select all your groups 
and then put them inside of another group,

00:16: as I have in this case here, and then apply 
a layer Effect to the group here inside of

00:22: Photoshop CS6. And I demonstrated how that worked 
back in Chapter 16 of my Intermediate course.

00:28: The problem is if you want to go ahead and 
drop out the letters and make them transparent,

00:31: as I have in this case, you might figure that 
you can set the Fill value to 0% but CS6 has

00:36: a bug in it currently that 
prevents that from saving.

00:39: So you have to come up with a different approach,
in my case I dropped out all that black text

00:44: by setting the blend mode for 
the entire group to screen.

00:47: Well, what if you want things to just work 
the way they are supposed to. In other words,

00:50: you want to just set the Fill value 
to 0% or some other reduced value?

00:54: In that case you are better off using a Smart 
Object and I am going to show you how that works.

00:58: So here I am with all my black letters, I am going 
to press Ctrl+;(Semicolon) or Cmd+;(Semicolon)

01:03: on the Mac to hide those guidelines.

01:05: And then I will click on the right group and 
Shift+Click on left group to select all three

01:09: groups and I will go up to Layers panel flyout 
menu and I will choose Convert to Smart Object.

01:14: Or you can press Ctrl+,(Comma) 
or Cmd+,(Comma) on the Mac.

01:17: So the idea is anything can become a Smart 
Object inside Photoshop, even entire groups

01:22: of layers, and notice after I choose the command, 
we are left with one Smart Object called left.

01:27: I am going to rename it all type, and then press 
the Enter key or the Return key on the Mac.

01:32: Now I'll reduce the Fill Opacity to 0% by 
pressing Shift+0+0 and that way all the letters

01:37: will drop out and we will just see 
the layer effect as we work on it.

01:41: And I will apply the layer Effect by dropping 
down to the fx icon at the bottom of the panel

01:45: and choosing Bevel & Emboss, and the default 
values actually work out pretty darn well.

01:50: So I have got a Style of Inner Bevel, a 
Technique of Smooth, the Depth value is set to 100%,

01:56: the Direction is Up, the Size and 
Soften are 5 and 0 respectively.

02:00: Angle and Altitude are set to the Global 
Light positions of a 135 and 30 degrees.

02:05: So actually the only change I am going to make 
here is to take the Highlight Modes Opacity

02:09: value up to 100% and then I will click OK 
in order to apply that effect and we end up

02:14: getting the exact same effect that I 
showed you at the onset of the movie.

02:18: Problem is some of the watermarks 
appear against the white background.

02:21: So we can't see the highlights of the bevel 
emboss effect at all, we are just left with

02:25: the shadows, which means that it might be 
nice to have a little bit of Fill Opacity.

02:29: So I will press Shift+2 in order to take the 
Fill value up to 20% and that's something

02:34: you would not be able to do 
with the standard layer group.

02:37: You can only achieve this kind of effect when 
applied to multiple layers; that is to say,

02:41: using a Smart Object.


 ** Editing originals; updating clones

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to open and 
edit the two originals associated with this

00:04: composition, in order to 
update all the true clones.

00:07: And in the end we'll wind up coming up 
with this effect here, in which the first

00:11: and third columns list URLs, and the middle 
column goes ahead and list the file numbers.

00:15: First, with this stock photograph of the guy with 
a big bicep, and then for the stock illustration

00:20: of the tattoo, so I'll go and switch to the 
image in progress here and I'll double-click

00:24: on the thumbnail for this all-time Smart Object, 
in order to open that Smart Object that contains

00:29: all of the groups.

00:31: And then I'll twirl open right, let's say, 
and double-click on the thumbnails for any

00:36: one of these Photos by Floyd layers.

00:38: And the reason you can double-click on any 
of the thumbnails is that they all take you

00:42: to the same original.

00:44: So I'll go and double-click on that thumbnail 
in order to open the original Smart Object,

00:48: and then I'll double-click on little T here 
in the Layers panel in order to switch over

00:52: to the Type tool and select all the text, and 
I'll press Ctrl+Shift+K or Cmd+Shift+K

00:57: on the Mac in order to turn off the All Cap Style 
and I'll change this text to fotolia.com/deke.

01:04: And then I'll press Ctrl+A or Cmd+A on 
the Mac in order to select all the text and

01:09: I'll press Ctrl+Shift+ > or Cmd+Shift+> 
a couple of times in a row, in order to

01:14: increase the size of that text to 28 points, 
as you can see up here in the Options bar.

01:20: Then press the Enter key on the numerical 
keypad in order to accept your change and

01:24: go to the Image menu and choose the Reveal All 
command and notice by the way, if you loaded

01:29: DekeKeys, I have given you a keyboard shortcut 
of Ctrl+Shift+Alt+B or Cmd+Shift+Opt+B

01:33: on the Mac and that's just because I assigned 
Ctrl+Shift+Alt+A or Cmd+Shift+Opt+A

01:38: to the task of flattening all layers, so I went ahead 
and gave Reveal All, the next letter in the alphabet.

01:44: Anyway, go ahead and choose that command and 
you'll get this effect here, and then close

01:48: the Smart Object, click on the Yes button here 
on the PC, with the Save button on the Mac,

01:52: in order to update those six true clones.

01:55: All right, now let's take 
care of the two middle layers.

01:58: By twirling open the middle group and double-clicking 
on the thumbnails for either of the file numbers

02:03: layers and that will open up this original, 
and I'll once again double-click on the

02:07: T thumbnail here in the Layers panel to switch 
to the Type tool and select all that text.

02:11: I'll press Ctrl+Shift+K or Cmd+Shift+K 
on the Mac in order to turn off all caps and

02:17: I'll dial in file numbers, colon (:) and then 
I've gone ahead and copied the file numbers

02:21: to the clipboard.

02:22: So I'll press the Ctrl+V or Cmd+V on the Mac 
in order to paste that text in to place

02:27: and I'll press Ctrl+A or Cmd+A on the Mac 
to Select All of that text, press Ctrl+Shift+>

02:32: or Cmd+Shift+> two times in a row in 
order to increase the type size to 28 points

02:37: once again, and then press Enter on the 
numerical keypad to accept that change.

02:42: And then, again visit the Image menu and choose 
Reveal All or take advantage of the shortcut,

02:47: either way, in order to 
expand that text like so.

02:50: Go ahead and close the Smart Object, click 
on the Yes button or the Save button on the Mac

02:54: in order to update those clones.

02:56: Now you can see that all of the URLs are 
violating the canvas, and so the solution is to

03:02: once again, go up to the Image menu and choose 
Reveal All in order to expand the canvas,

03:07: so none of the text gets clipped, and then go 
ahead and close this Smart Object and click

03:11: the Yes button on the PC or the Save button 
on the Mac in order to update all of the text

03:16: in one operation here 
inside the larger composition.

03:20: And so, if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on 
the Mac, we'll see the original watermark,

03:25: and then if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on 
the Mac again, I'll see the new watermarks

03:29: that we updated inside this very movie.

03:33: And that, friends, is some of the power that's 
afforded to us by True Clones and Smart Objects,

03:38: here inside Photoshop.


 ** Removing people from a scene with Median

00:00: In this movie I'll show you one final use 
for Smart Objects, which allows you to remove

00:04: people from a scene using a Stack mode known 
as Median, but I will warn you, this feature

00:10: only exists inside Photoshop Extended.

00:13: So if you have the standard version of the 
software, you will not have access to Stack Modes.

00:17: In which case you can go ahead and 
skip ahead to the next chapter.

00:21: I'm looking in a subfolder inside the 
24_smart_objects folder called Vicenza pics.

00:26: And if you go ahead and click on Teatro Olimpico-1
and Shift+Click on Teatro Olimpico-4,

00:33: then you'll select four different files.

00:35: I'm going to press the Spacebar in order to 
preview the image at full screen, and you

00:39: can see, as I advance from one image to the 
other, that while the scene is fairly stationary,

00:45: I wasn't using a tripod, so 
things bounce around a little bit.

00:49: But the biggest difference is that we have my 
friend Colleen walking across the foreground.

00:55: So let's say, much as I like Colleen, I want to go 
ahead and get rid of her where the scene is concerned.

00:59: Well, here's how.

01:01: I press the Escape key to return to the Bridge and 
then go ahead and select those four images once again.

01:06: You don't want to have Stack mode Median.psd selected,
because that's the final version of the file.

01:12: With those four images selected, and by the way, 
if you were trying this with your own images,

01:15: you need at least three shots to make it work.

01:19: Then go up to the tools menu, choose Photoshop 
and choose Load Files into Photoshop layers.

01:24: And that will go ahead and launch Photoshop and 
combine those images into a layered composition.

01:29: All right, now I'll press Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0 
on the Mac in order to zoom in slightly.

01:35: And I want you to see here, I'm going to 
click on the bottommost layer and then Alt+Click

01:38: or Opt+Click on its eyeball.

01:40: And now I can press Alt+] to advance through
these layers and you can see that things

01:45: bounce around quite a bit.

01:46: We need to go ahead and align these layers together.

01:49: So I'll go and Shift+Click on the bottommost 
layer, so that all four layers are selected

01:54: and then I'll go up to the Edit 
menu and choose Auto-Align layers.

01:58: And that will bring up this dialog box here.

02:00: You want to leave Projection set to Auto and leave 
the two Lens Correction checkboxes turned off,

02:05: and then click OK, and Photoshop will 
automatically distort and align the layers,

02:10: so that they better overlap.

02:12: Now let's check what's happened here.

02:14: I'll click on that topmost layer to make it 
active, so that we have one layer active and

02:18: it's the only layer that's visible.

02:20: And then I'll press Alt+[ or Option+[ on the Mac 
to advance down the stack, and you can

02:25: see now that all four of the 
images perfectly align.

02:29: All right, the next thing you need to do is 
turn on all the layers, and then click on

02:33: the bottommost layer, Shift+Click on the 
topmost so that all the layers are selected and go

02:37: to the Layers panel flyout menu and choose 
Convert to Smart Object or press that keyboard

02:41: shortcut of Ctrl+Comma(,), 
Cnd+Comma(,) on the Mac.

02:44: All right, now for the moment of truth.

02:47: Now Photoshop Extended ships with a bunch 
of Stack modes, but you wouldn't know it,

02:50: because they're so hard to get to.

02:52: You go up to the layer menu, you choose Smart 
Objects, then you choose Stack mode, and if

02:56: you don't see this command, it's because 
you have a standard version of the software.

03:01: And then you have access to a variety of different 
Stack modes that you can apply one at a time,

03:05: so only one Stack mode can be 
applied to any given Smart Object.

03:10: Now just by way of example, I'll go ahead and 
choose Mean, each one of these modes blends

03:15: the images together differently.

03:17: And when you choose Mean you end up getting 
the average luminance levels from all four

03:21: of the images inside of the Smart Object, 
and as a result we have these Colleen ghost

03:27: that are traveling across the scene.

03:29: So if you want that kind of effect, 
then Mean is the Stack mode of choice.

03:32: I'm going to go ahead and expand this layer so 
that we can see the Stack mode listed below

03:36: the Smart Object name.

03:37: And as long as I'm here I'll go ahead 
and rename the Smart Object all layers.

03:41: All right, so that's pretty interesting, there 
are some other ones that are available to you.

03:44: I'll go up to the Layer menu, choose Smart 
Objects again, choose Stack mode, fairly laborious

03:50: to switch between these guys.

03:52: And I'll choose Minimum and what that's going 
to do is keep the minimum luminance level,

03:55: in other words, the darkest color 
from all of the layers combined.

04:00: And as a result we're going to get some pretty 
flushed out versions of all the Colleens in

04:03: the scene, because she's 
wearing that dark clothing.

04:06: It doesn't entirely give us just Colleens, 
however, because she's got some lines going

04:11: through the highlights in her face, which 
after all are brighter than the background.

04:15: However, the effect I really want to achieve is 
to eliminate Colleen from the scene entirely.

04:20: And to do that you go up to the layer menu, 
choose Smart Objects, choose Stack mode, and

04:24: then choose this guy right there, Median.

04:27: And that will find the most popular luminance 
level associated with all of the layers, and

04:32: because Colleen only appears on one layer at any 
given position, she ends up being 100% eliminated.

04:38: All right, I'm going to press Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0
once again in order to back out of the scene.

04:44: And now I want to go ahead and crop things, 
because after all we have some weirdness down

04:48: here in the corners.

04:49: So using the Rectangular Marquee tool 
I'm just going to draw a selection

04:53: about yea big here that ends up capturing 
what I considered to be more less the ideal

04:57: composition for the scene.

04:59: It's certainly symmetrical.

05:01: And now I'll go up to the 
Image menu and choose Crop.

05:04: Now normally the Crop command is going to delete 
all the pixels that are outside the selection.

05:09: The only exception is when you're using a 
Smart Object, because after all Smart Objects

05:13: by definition cannot be cropped.

05:16: So I'll go ahead and choose that command and we 
end up getting this final version of the scene.

05:20: I'll press Ctrl+D or Cmd+D 
on the Mac in order to deselect.

05:23: I might want to brighten things up as well, 
so I'll click the black/white icon at the

05:27: bottom of the panel, choose Brightness/Contrast,
and I'll go ahead and take the Brightness

05:32: value up to 20 and I'll take the Contrast 
value down to -20, and we get this final version

05:39: of the composition.

05:40: Now I'll press Shift+F in order to fill the 
screen with the image and zoom in as well,

05:44: and that's how you use the Median Stack mode 
to eliminate people and other moving objects

05:49: from a scene.


 ** Luminance meets sharpening

00:00: As a follow-up to Smart Objects, I now present you 
with a command that complements Smart Objects.

00:06: It lives with the Color Adjustments, but it 
works as a Smart Filter and it goes by the

00:10: name Shadows Highlights.

00:13: Its job is to brighten shadows, that is, 
make them less shadowy and darken highlights.

00:19: So it reduces the contrast of an image, 
but it does so like a sharpening filter.

00:23: In other words, it traces bright halos inside 
the shadows and dark halos inside the highlights,

00:30: which mean that as you correct the luminance 
of a photograph, you also increase its impact.

00:35: For example, over the course of this chapter, 
we're going to take this nicely composed photograph

00:40: and turn it into this.

00:42: Which I think is interesting, because we 
start with the photo that looks fine, right?

00:47: And then we turned it into 
something that looks fantastic.

00:49: And you know why, I know that, you are going 
to learn a lot from this chapter,

00:55: because I've got this guy and he's just 
going to stare the information into you.


 ** Correcting for lens distortion

00:00: Over the course of this project we're going 
to take this portrait shot, which has some

00:04: great composition in my opinion, but is a 
little bit flat in terms of the contouring, so in

00:08: another words, his face is lit from 
straight on and ends up washing out a little bit.

00:14: And we're going to give it some more volume; 
we're going to give it some more depth

00:17: in order to come up with this final effect here.

00:19: I should say this image once again hails from 
the Fotolia Image Library, about which you

00:23: can learn more and get discounts 
by the way at fotolia.com/deke.

00:27: Now the first thing we need to do is correct for the 
Lens Distortion that's associated with this image.

00:32: Notice if I switch back to the original, not 
only is the image crooked so it's leaning

00:38: down into the right, but his head is leaning 
in the opposite direction, almost as if it

00:42: is skewed, which means once we straighten the 
image, he's going to look more crooked than ever.

00:46: Also, notice that the right half of his face, 
his left, appears narrower than the left half

00:52: of the face, and presumably a lot of 
that has to do with Lens Distortion.

00:57: The idea is that there's curvature associated 
with the lens element and as the light enters

01:02: that element and then lights on to the image 
sensor, the light actually distorts on its

01:07: way into the image and usually that 
distortion is found around the outside edge.

01:11: Fortunately, we can correct for Lens 
Distortion using a filter known as Lens Correction.

01:17: We want to apply that filter as a Smart Filter 
of course, so I'm going to convert this image

01:21: into a Smart Object by double-clicking on 
the background here inside the Layers panel

01:25: and I'm just going to Name this layer dude.

01:27: And then I'll go up to the Layers panel 
flyout menu and choose Convert to Smart Object,

01:31: or if you loaded DekeKeys, you can 
press Ctrl+, or Cmd+, on the Mac.

01:35: Next, go up to the Filter menu and choose 
Lens Correction, which has a factory keyboard

01:39: shortcut of Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R 
on the Mac, and that's going to bring up this

01:44: big huge screen-gobbling dialog box.

01:47: Now you probably want to start things off 
inside the Auto Correction tab, and notice

01:51: down here in the bottom-left corner of the 
window, we can see the camera model, which

01:55: is a Canon EOS 5D Mark II.

01:58: We might also be able to see the lens model, although 
in this case we can't, so we'll have to make that up.

02:03: But we can see the Focal 
Length, which is 40 mm.

02:06: So let's go ahead and dial in what 
we know into the Search Criteria.

02:09: The Camera Make is already set to Canon.

02:11: I'll go ahead and select from Camera 
Model the 5D Mark II from the list.

02:16: And by default Photoshop goes ahead and grabs 
a 28mm lens, which is good enough where this

02:21: image is concerned.

02:23: Presumably a lens like that does work.

02:25: Now I recommend you go ahead 
and turn on all the checkboxes.

02:28: By default you may only have Geometric 
Distortion turned; on you definitely want that turned

02:33: on of course, because that's the main thing that 
we're trying to correct where this image is concerned.

02:38: We're going to learn more about Chromatic 
Aberration when we take a look at Camera RAW

02:41: in the future chapter, but for now just know 
that it's a misregistration of color around

02:46: the outer edges of the image.

02:48: Just about every image has some form of 
Chromatic Aberration associated with it, so you might

02:52: as well go ahead and turn that checkbox on.

02:55: And if your image has vignetting, that is 
presumably darkness around the outer edge

02:59: created by the lens element itself casting a 
shadow, then go ahead and turn on the Vignette

03:04: checkbox, and you'll see that it makes a 
slight difference where this image is concerned.

03:08: All right, the next thing you want to do is 
switch over to Custom so that we can modify

03:12: the Geometric Distortion by hand.

03:15: If you drag this slider to the left in order 
to apply a negative value, then you're going

03:19: to create a kind of bulging 
effect like we're seeing here.

03:22: If you move the slider to the right that gives you a 
positive value and you create a pin-cushioning effect.

03:28: We do want a pin-cushioning effect, but not 
that much, so I'm going to start with a value

03:32: of 0, and I'm going to press Shift+Up Arrow 
a few times in a row in order to increase

03:37: that value in single digit increments.

03:40: And by the time you get to a value of +10, 
somewhere in that range, things start looking good.

03:45: You notice that the two halves of his 
head look a lot more proportional.

03:48: Next, I'm going to drop down to this Angle 
value and we want to modify it as well, and

03:53: what I suggest you do here is press Shift+Down 
Arrow in order to incrementally rotate that

03:58: image down into the left; that is 
in a counterclockwise fashion.

04:03: And at about -0.8, you end up getting a 
straight horizon, and to confirm that you can turn

04:09: on the Show Grid checkbox, so that you can 
see that grid there, which is going to show

04:13: you an exactly horizontal line so that you can 
compare it to the horizon in the background.

04:19: And that ends up creating a very nice effect,
so I'll go ahead and click OK in order to

04:24: correct that lens distortion.

04:26: So just to give you a sense of what we were 
able to accomplish here, this is the before

04:29: version of the image quite distorted by 
comparison, and this is the after version.

04:35: Thanks to the Lens Correction 
filter, here inside Photoshop.


 ** Introducing Shadows/Highlights

00:00: In this movie I'm going to introduce 
you to the Shadows/Highlights filter.

00:03: We first saw it back in Chapter 7 of the fundamentals 
course, but in these next couple of movies

00:08: I'm going to give you a much better 
sense of how the filter works.

00:11: Now if you take a look at the final version 
of the image here, you'll see that there are

00:14: only three filters assigned to the Smart Object, 
they're High Pass, Gaussian Blur, and Shadows/Highlights.

00:20: Notice that Lens Correction is missing and 
that's because I needed to apply this Filter

00:25: Mask, but the Filter Mask could not effect 
the Lens Correction filter, because if it did,

00:29: we would burrow our way down to the distorted 
image, which wouldn't work at all. Which means

00:35: what we need to do is put our current Smart 
Object inside of another Smart Object,

00:39: so that it is not affected by this 
Filter Mask, and here's how that works.

00:43: I'll go ahead and switch back to my image in 
progress, and with the dude layer selected

00:48: go up to the Layers panel flyout menu and choose 
Convert to Smart Object or press Ctrl+Comma(,),

00:52: Cmd+Comma(,) on the Mac and you'll see 
that you've put the old Smart Object into

00:57: a new Smart Object, because after all the filter 
list as well as the filter mask have disappeared.

01:02: All right, now let's go up to the Image menu 
and choose Adjustments, and you'll see that

01:07: Shadows/Highlights is available to you, because 
even though it's listed as a color adjustment,

01:12: it actually functions as a filter, because 
it's looking for edges inside of an image

01:17: much like the Sharpening filters and Gaussian blur 
and the other edge filters inside the software.

01:23: If you loaded dekeKeys, I've given you a 
keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+Alt+H or Cmd+Opt+H

01:27: on the Mac and that goes ahead and 
brings up the Shadows/Highlights dialog box.

01:32: Now the idea behind this filter 
is pretty darn simple, initially.

01:36: The Shadows value allows you to brighten up 
the Shadows and the Highlights value allows

01:41: you to darken the highlights.

01:43: By default you get a ton of shadow 
brightening and no highlight darkening at all.

01:48: That's exactly the opposite of what we want.

01:51: Our shadows were bright enough in first place.

01:53: So I'm going to take that Shadows value down to say 
about 10%, until we get this effect right here.

02:00: And if you want to get a sense for the effect of 
the filter, you can turn the Preview checkbox

02:04: off in order to see the original shadows in 
the image, and then turn that checkbox back

02:08: on, in order to see the brighter shadows.

02:11: We really need this Highlights value.

02:13: So I'm going to press Shift+Up Arrow in order 
to incrementally take those highlights down.

02:18: And you can see by the time we get into the 80% 
range for example he looks like he's been

02:23: either slapped around or of 
course he has horrible sunburn.

02:27: Neither of which are the least bit 
indicative of that original photo.

02:31: So I'm going to take this value down, let's 
say to 45% where this image is concerned.

02:38: Now you might say that looks pretty bad, after 
all if I turn the Preview checkbox off,

02:42: you'll see that he looks brighter, more natural 
color is going on inside of his face as well.

02:46: If I turn that Preview checkbox on, well, 
we have a lot more potentially volumetric

02:51: detail going on inside the highlights.

02:53: We also have this sunburn effect which 
is not something that we want at all.

02:58: Also we've got a fair amount of haloing.

03:00: I'm going to click inside that Amount value and 
then Ctrl+Spacebar+Click, Cmd+Spacebar+Click

03:05: along the horizon right there and you can see 
this bounce of highlight above the horizon,

03:11: a little bit of extra darkening being applied 
below the horizon as well, and that's because

03:16: this is an Edge filter.

03:18: It is drawing halos around the image, and 
those halos can become awfully darn noticeable

03:24: in certain areas, notice these halos that are 
appearing around his collar into the flesh

03:28: of his neck as well.

03:30: And we're enhancing some of the bad stuff 
inside the image, such as the posterization

03:34: along the shadows inside of his neck.

03:37: And that's all happening 
because of those halos.

03:39: The problem is we have no control over those halos 
by default where Shadows/Highlights are concerned.

03:46: We need control, which is why you have the 
Show More Options checkbox, and I'm going

03:50: to show you what that control 
looks like inside the next movie.


 ** Mitigating halos with Radius values

00:00: All right, I went ahead and applied that Shadows/
Highlights modification that I showed you in the previous

00:03: movie and we end up 
getting this sunburn effect.

00:06: Turns out I'm going to be using those exact 
same percentage values, 10% for the Shadows

00:10: and 45% for the Highlights, in order to 
achieve our final much better effect right here.

00:17: The big difference is I was able to distribute my 
radius, and let me show you what that looks like.

00:21: I'll go ahead and switch back to the image 
in progress here, and because I'm working

00:25: with the Smart Object I applied 
Shadows/Highlights as a Smart Filter.

00:28: I'll go ahead and double-click on the words 
Shadows/Highlights to bring up my settings

00:32: because after all Smart 
Filters are fully editable.

00:35: And I'm going to turn on this 
Show More Options checkbox.

00:38: So the idea is there is a Product Manager 
somewhere saying, we can't have this many

00:42: options inside this filter, 
because it will just overwhelm folks.

00:45: And there is this engineer in the background 
saying, no, you know what, we need all these

00:49: controls, which we definitely do.

00:51: So let's give the user the 
option to turn them on or off.

00:54: Anyway, in our case we need them turned on.

00:56: We've got a couple of Tonal Width values, 
notice that right there, and what they determine

01:01: is how much of the image 
comprises shadows and highlights.

01:04: So right now by default we're saying that 
the darkest 50% of the image are shadows,

01:10: and the lightest 50% of the 
image are considered highlights.

01:12: And it drops off over the luminance range.

01:15: So in other words, if I were to increase that 
Tonal Width value to 100%, then I'm saying

01:19: that black is definitely a shadow and white 
is considered just barely to be a shadow and

01:25: everything else is ramping in between.

01:28: So you can see as a result by cranking up 
the Tonal Width value, I'm brightening more

01:32: the image than I was before.

01:33: So if I restore this value to 50% that's what 
we were seeing before, just the brightening

01:37: of the darkest 50% of the colors.

01:40: And if I change this to 100%, now we're 
brightening to some extent or rather all of the

01:44: luminance levels inside the image.

01:46: The thing is when in doubt I 
recommend you leave this set to 50%.

01:50: If you're going to modify, you want to 
modify the other value and kind, for example,

01:53: if I'm saying all right, 70% of the colors are 
in the shadow range, then I don't want 50%

01:59: of the colors to be in the highlights range, 
because that would mean that 20% of the luminance

02:03: levels inside the image are being first brightened 
and then darkened, which doesn't make any sense.

02:08: So I would take this value down to 30% in 
order to compensate, but in most cases you

02:15: want to leave both values set to 50,
and in this case I do as well.

02:19: What I'm really interested in changing where 
this image is concerned, and this will be true

02:23: for most of the images you work 
on as well, is this Radius Value.

02:27: Right, now both values are 
set to Radius of 30 pixels.

02:30: And if I were to crank this value down, let's 
say I take the Radius value for Highlights

02:35: down to 10 pixels here, you'll see that I 
have much sharper halos around the image,

02:40: especially between the collar and his neck, 
and it's almost like we're applying a kind

02:44: of sharpening effect.

02:45: What you want to do is get rid of those 
halos by distributing them as much as possible,

02:50: and that means raising this radius value as 
high as you can go, really, and get the effect

02:55: you want to achieve inside the image.

02:57: For example, if I take this value up to 100 
pixels that means that I'm going to get rid

03:01: of my halos, as you can see they're 
almost altogether gone throughout the image.

03:06: However, that also means that I'm not going to 
produce much of an effect inside the Highlights

03:11: for example, inside the eyes, because I 
just don't have enough room to work.

03:14: There isn't a 100 pixels worth of 
information inside of those eyes.

03:18: So it's a bit of a trade-off, but in my case 
100 pixels works just fine, and I'm also going

03:23: to take the Radius value for Shadows up to 
100 pixels as well, and you could take it

03:28: even higher if you wanted to.

03:29: We can try something like 200 pixels and that 
definitely spreads the shadows out that much more.

03:34: So let's go for it.

03:36: All right, now I'll go ahead and click OK 
in order to apply the modifications we've

03:40: made so far, and just to give you a sense 
of the dramatic difference we've been able

03:44: to achieve here, I'll press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on 
the Mac; you can see that my previous application

03:49: of Shadows/Highlights was much 
flatter and surreal, as well, by comparison.

03:54: And if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on the 
Mac in order to reapply those modifications,

03:59: my halos will almost entirely disappear and 
we'll get a lot more volumetric information.

04:05: Problem is, we still have too much color 
saturation in the form of that synthetic sunburn there,

04:11: and we might want to bring out a little bit 
of midtone action as well, and I'll show you

04:15: how to do just that in the next movie.


 ** Enhancing the effects of Midtone Contrast

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to correct for  
the overly saturated colors inside this image,

00:04: and also show you how to 
increase the contrast of the midtones.

00:07: We accomplished both feeds from 
the Shadows/Highlights dialog box.

00:11: So I'll double-click on word Shadows/Highlights 
here inside the Layers panel in order to bring

00:15: the dialog box back up on screen.

00:18: Notice this Color Correction value right there.

00:20: If you increase that value, you're not going to 
correct the colors; you're going to increase

00:23: the saturation of the colors inside the image,
so it's ultimately a saturation slider.

00:28: And notice if you want to get rid of the saturation, 
you would take that Color Correction value down.

00:33: By default it's set to 20, which I think is 
absolutely insane, given that what you want is 0,

00:39: because when you set that value to 0, you do not 
modify the saturation of the original colors at all.

00:46: Now you may end up getting a little bit of 
grayness inside of some areas of the image,

00:52: especially where the midtones are concerned.

00:54: We can see a little bit of grayness for 
example, around this right-hand ear.

00:58: However, that can be adjusted for in better 
ways, than just cranking up the saturation

01:03: of all colors throughout the image.

01:06: And the better way is to adjust 
this midtone contrast value.

01:09: So notice, if I take this value up, we increase 
the contrast, the luminance levels in general.

01:15: This one is not an edge detection effect, 
so it's not using haloing; it's closer to

01:19: a straight contrast adjustment, like you would 
achieve using the Brightness/Contrast command.

01:23: And of course, if you want less contrast, 
you would reduce that contrast value, but

01:28: that's when you start seeing a lot of grays 
throughout the midtones inside the image.

01:33: So what I'm going to do is start at 100, just 
the maximum value and then press Shift+Down Arrow

01:38: in order to reduce that 
value in increments of 10.

01:41: And at about 40 we end up 
getting an effect that I really like.

01:44: And we also have a Black Clip and White Clip.

01:47: What these are saying, by default once again, 
is that Photoshop is going to clip up to 0.01%

01:55: of the luminance levels inside the image.

01:56: In other words, a hundredth of a percent of 
luminance levels are going to clip to black,

02:01: and a hundredth of a percent of luminance 
levels are going to clip to white.

02:04: If you were all worried about that, just 
change these values to 0, and you're going to see

02:08: a subtle difference, if you take the Black Clip 
value down to 0%, so no clipping is occurring.

02:12: You're not going to see much difference at 
all if you take that White Clip value down to 0%,

02:16: and then, if you like what you see, 
you can always save these settings as your

02:20: new defaults, which will be great because 
you've got big Radius values, you've also

02:25: got 0 for Color Correction, which is a great 
place to start, and we have a pretty

02:30: enthusiastic Midtone Contrast value as well.

02:32: In my case I'm going to leave things alone, 
and I'll click on the OK button in order to

02:36: accept my changes.

02:38: And once again let's see 
the before and after here.

02:40: This is the before version of the image.

02:42: More than anything else you can see that the 
colors were just ridiculously saturated and

02:46: he has got that sunburn effect to 
just about all of the skin tones.

02:50: And this is the after effect, with not only 
much better colors inside the image, but more

02:55: of a dynamic effect throughout the midtones with a 
striking degree of contrast throughout this image.

03:01: And just to get a sense for the overall effect 
of the filter, I'll turn Smart Filters off.

03:06: This is the original version of the 
image, quite washed out by comparison.

03:10: And if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on the 
Mac; that turns the filter back on to show

03:15: a much more dramatic effect.


 ** Creating a "bounce" with Gaussian Blur

00:00: In the next few movies we're going to further 
enhance the impact of this image using a combination

00:05: of Gaussian Blur and High Pass.

00:07: While these steps don't have anything to do 
specifically with the Shadow/Highlights command

00:11: they will further impact the shadows and 
highlights inside the image and you'll get a sense of

00:16: how to work with multiple Smart Filters along 
with the filter mask here inside Photoshop.

00:21: So let's start things off with very 
traditional Gaussian Blur effect.

00:25: I'm going to go up to the Filter menu, 
choose Blur, and then choose Gaussian Blur

00:30: or if you loaded dekeKeys you can use 
my keyboard shortcut Shift+F6.

00:34: I'm going to take that Gaussian Blur value 
up very high to 15 pixels and essentially

00:40: what I'm trying to do is blur way pretty 
much all of the edges inside of this image.

00:45: Then go ahead and click OK in 
order to apply that a fact.

00:49: Now so far we are not doing much to 
increase the impact of the image at all.

00:52: In fact, we are just making the image 
appears as if we've taken off our glasses.

00:56: What we need to do is adjust the Blend mode 
for this specific filter by double-clicking

01:01: on this little slider icons to the right of 
the words Gaussian Blur here inside Layers

01:05: panel and that'll bring up the 
Blending Options dialog box.

01:09: I'm going to click on the fellow's face there 
in order to center the portion of the image

01:13: so we can see inside of the dialog box and 
then I'll zoom out little bit as well so we

01:17: can see is eyes and nose.

01:19: I'm to change the mode from Normal to the 
first of the contrast modes which is Overlay,

01:24: and you can see that restores all of the detail 
and clarity of the image, but we get a little

01:29: bit of an edge bounce as well.

01:31: Now I'll go ahead and click OK 
in order to accept that effect.

01:35: Now just so you have a sense of the effect 
of this filter I'll turn Gaussian Blur off.

01:39: This is the way the image look before.

01:41: If I turn the filter back on, 
this is the way it looks now.

01:43: The problem is the Overlay Blend mode not 
only goes ahead and increases the contrast

01:48: of the luminance levels inside the image, it also 
increases the saturation of the color values.

01:54: To compensate we need to take the saturation levels 
down and we can do that using Shadows/Highlights.

02:00: So I'm going to double-click on Shadows/Highlights 
once again and most likely, you'll get an

02:05: alert message which is telling you that as 
you work inside Shadows/Highlights you're

02:10: not going to see the effects of any 
filters applied on top up that filter.

02:14: Meaning we won't see Gaussian Blur.

02:16: Just go head and click OK in 
order to bring up the dialog box.

02:19: Notice that we're seeing 
shadows highlights by itself.

02:22: Then drop down to the Color Correction value 
and let's take it all the way down to -100

02:28: which is as low as it can go.

02:30: Notice that; that doesn't entirely 
get rid of the saturation values.

02:33: In other words, we're not creating a grayscale 
image, but we are diminishing the saturation

02:37: levels pretty significantly.

02:39: Now click OK and Photoshop will go ahead and 
show you the results of both Shadows/Highlights

02:44: and Gaussian Blur working together.

02:47: So just so you have a sense of what just 
happened I'll press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on a Mac.

02:52: These are the saturation values that are evident 
if we don't reduce the Color Correction value

02:56: inside shadow highlights and this is what 
we get by taking the saturation values down

03:02: before Gaussian Blur is applied.

03:04: I also wanted you to see what we 
pulled off over the course of this movie.

03:07: So I'll press the F12 key in order to revert 
the image to its original appearance with

03:12: just shadows highlights applied.

03:14: So this is the image with shadows highlights 
by itself and if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z

03:18: on a Mac, this is the new version of the 
image with that bounce of luminance and contrast

03:24: created using Gaussian Blur combined 
along with the Overlay Blend mode.


 ** Sharpening on top of blur

00:00: Now I need to compensate for the effects of 
Gaussian Blur, which has slightly blurred

00:04: the detail inside this image, and that means 
we need to sharpen the image slightly,

00:09: and because this is a portrait shot, the 
best filter for the job is high pass.

00:13: So I'll go up to the Filter menu, choose Other, 
and then choose High Pass, and notice if you

00:18: loaded dekeKeys it's got a 
keyboard shortcut, a Shift+F10.

00:22: And what you want to do is set the High Pass 
Filter to a radius that still allows you to

00:28: see the edges, now ten is way too much but I 
found if I took it down to about five pixels

00:33: I could still see a little bit of edged 
detail while most of the image turns gray.

00:37: Then I will go ahead and click OK 
in order to accept that effect.

00:41: Now we need to turn this filter into Sharpening 
Effect and we'll do so by modifying the Blend mode.

00:47: So double-click on the slider icon 
to the right of the words High Pass.

00:51: Now we'll bring up the 
Blending Options dialog box.

00:54: Now most of the time you want to start 
things off with the first of the contrast modes,

00:58: which is Overlay, and that will end up 
providing us with a little bit of sharpening,

01:02: and just to get a better sense of what's 
going on I'll Zoom in to 50%.

01:06: And so you can see how we have some more tactile 
detail side of the photograph, it's not enough, however.

01:12: So the next thing you'd want to do when you 
are fooling around with High Pass like this,

01:16: is try out a Blend mode that has a little 
bit more impact, and that would be the

01:20: Hard Light mode, and that's going to end 
up increasing the sharpness slightly.

01:24: If that's still not enough which I don't believe 
it to be, then you want to dropdown two more

01:28: blend modes to Linear Light and go ahead and 
try that one out and that gives us a very

01:33: sharp effect indeed.

01:34: The problem is, the 
Radius value is set too high.

01:37: So I will go ahead and click OK in 
order to accept the effect so far.

01:40: And by the way I am working on a standard 
density screen here, so a zoom level of 50%

01:45: is ideal for gauging how sharp this image is 
going to look when I print it at say 300 ppi.

01:52: But you may be lucky enough to be working 
on a retina display like the one included

01:56: with the new MacBook Pro, in which case you 
should be able to zoom all the way into a 100%,

01:59: because there are so many 
pixels packed on those screens.

02:04: All right, now I am going to take down the Radius 
value for my High Pass Filter by double-clicking

02:09: in the words High Pass here inside the Layers 
panel, and then I'll go ahead and click on

02:13: the eye in order to center it inside the 
dialog box, and I will take the Radius value down

02:18: by pressing Shift+Down Arrow couple of times 
in a row until I get a Radius of 3 pixels,

02:23: which looks a lot better.

02:24: The details in other words look more sharply 
defined and then I will click OK in order

02:29: to accept that effect.

02:31: So if I turn-off High Pass you can see this 
is the slightly blurred version of the image

02:35: and then if I press Ctrl+Z 
or Cmd+Z on the Mac.

02:38: this is the sharper version.

02:40: Thanks to the High Pass Filter combined with the 
Linear Light Blend mode here inside Photoshop.


 ** Masking a group of Smart Filters

00:00: Now at this point we are 
losing too much shadow detail.

00:02: You will notice, if you check out the final 
version of the image that the shadows are

00:06: brighter and that's what we want.

00:08: So what we need to do is create a Filter Mask 
and we have a Filter Mask available to us

00:14: here inside the Layers panel, but it happens 
to be empty, thereby indicating that were

00:19: not masking the filters at all.

00:21: Now we are going to create what might be the 
easiest kind of mask to make inside of Photoshop,

00:26: which is a Luminance Mask.

00:27: That is to say we are drawing out the 
natural luminance levels inside the image.

00:32: That will allow us to mask away the dark stuff and 
keep the bright stuff where the filters are concerned.

00:38: So I am going to start things off by turning 
off the eyeball in front of Smart Filters.

00:42: That will temporarily hide the filters.

00:45: Then you want to go up to the Channels panel 
to check out the channels that are associated

00:49: with the original image.

00:50: We will start with the Red channel; which 
of course, because this is a portrait chart,

00:54: is going to be the brightest, because we all 
resonate most brightly inside the Red channel.

00:59: The Green channel is going to give us the 
best detail information; it's the closest

01:03: to the composite grayscale version of the image.

01:05: And then finally, we have got the Blue channel in which 
the skin tones are going to appear relatively dark.

01:11: And basically really everything inside the 
image darkens up quite a bit, except for the

01:15: shirt which appears brighter.

01:17: We want that shirt to appear as dark as possible and 
the flesh tones to appear as bright as possible.

01:22: So we want to lift the Red channel.

01:24: So all you have to do in order to turn that 
into a filter mask is press the Ctrl key or

01:29: the Cmd key on the Mac and click on that Red 
channel in order to load it up as a selection.

01:34: So that is to say the highlights become the most 
selected and the shadows become the most deselected.

01:40: Then switch back to the RGB image.

01:42: Go back to Layers panel and turn 
the Smart Filters set back on.

01:46: Now at this point we can work with the existing 
layer mask if we had to, but that would mean

01:50: reversing the selection by 
choosing the inverse command.

01:53: The easier way to work is just to right-click 
inside of this Filter Mask and choose Delete

01:58: Filter Mask to get rid of it, or if you loaded 
dekeKeys by the way, you can press the keyboard

02:03: shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Q or 
Cmd+Option+Q on the Mac.

02:07: The idea being we are quitting that filter 
mask, and now we will create a new one by

02:11: right-clicking on the word Smart Filters and 
choosing Add Filter Mask and that will convert

02:17: the selection outline into a mask like so.

02:20: And notice, thanks to the mask, we are now 
revealing the original shadow detail inside the image.

02:25: And so if I were to Shift+Click on this 
Filter Mask Thumbnail, I temporarily turn it off

02:29: like so, and you can see that the image darkens up 
considerably, especially inside the shadow detail.

02:35: And if I Shift+Click in the Mask Thumbnail 
again, to turn it on, then we can see the

02:39: new brighter shadows.

02:41: Now to my eye it looks like we have taken 
a little bit too much of the oomph out of

02:45: the shadows, and so to compensate, we need 
to reduce the density of this filter mask,

02:50: and I will show you how 
that works in the next movie.


 ** Reducing the density of a layer mask

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to 
reduce the density of a filter mask.

00:03: So, here is the idea.

00:05: If the mask doesn't have enough impact, if 
you want to increase its contrast, then you

00:10: select the filter mask by clicking on it here 
inside the Layers panel, and then you press

00:15: Ctrl+L, or Cmd+L on the Mac in order to 
bring up the Levels dialog box, and you'd

00:20: increase the Black point value like so, and 
then you decrease the White point value.

00:26: And I am doing so in both cases 
by pressing Shift+Down Arrow.

00:29: That would preserve more of the shadow detail 
from the original image, and bump up the degree

00:34: to which the filters are impacting the highlights.

00:36: But we also end up with these strange edges, 
definitely not an effect we're looking for.

00:41: If you want to reduce the impact of the mask 
which is what we're looking to do, then you

00:45: can modify the Black point and White 
point values for the output levels.

00:49: However, there's a better way to work.

00:50: So, I'm going to cancel out of the Levels 
dialog box, and I'll double-click on the filter

00:55: mask thumbnail in the Layers panel to bring 
up the Properties panel which includes the

00:59: total of five options when you're working 
on a mask, starting off with Density which

01:04: is the option that we're looking for.

01:06: And as I reduce this Density value from 100%, 
keep your eye on the filter mask thumbnail

01:12: here inside the Layers panel and you can see 
that we're reducing the contrast of the mask,

01:16: specifically we're brightening the shadows.

01:19: That is to say we're turning the blacks, 
incrementally brighter shades of gray.

01:23: Now, I can take this Density value all the 
way down to 0% in which case we eliminate

01:29: that mask entirely, or so it would seem. 
We've actually only done so on-the-fly.

01:34: So I could go ahead and hide the panel, I 
could close this image, I can wait five weeks,

01:39: I can open the image again, double-click on 
that filter mask thumbnail, and that Density

01:44: value is still sitting there at 0%.

01:46: If I take it all the way back to 100%, then I 
restore that filter mask, because it's still

01:52: actually sitting there, no matter what 
modifications I make to this Density value.

01:56: In other words, Density is a parametric effect, 
that is, it relies on the numerical parameter

02:02: and you can modify it anytime you like.

02:04: In my case, I want to take that Density value 
down to about 80% to achieve this effect here,

02:11: and so that just takes a little bit of the 
wind out of the mask, meaning that I'm restoring

02:16: some degree, 20%, of the impact associated 
with these three Smart Filters, and now

02:23: I'll hide the Properties panel in 
order to get it off screen.

02:25: Now, at this point, you may feel like you've 
gone a little bit too far with the contrast

02:30: inside the image.

02:31: If you want to back it off a little bit, then 
drop down to the Black/White icon at the bottom

02:35: of the Layers panel and choose 
the Brightness/Contrast command.

02:39: And that will bring up the Brightness/Contrast 
controls in the Properties panel, press Shift+Enter,

02:43: or Shift+Return on the Mac to highlight the 
Brightest value, press the Tab key to highlight

02:48: the Contrast value, and then press Shift+Down 
Arrow perhaps three times in a row to reduce

02:53: the contrast to -30, and then go ahead and 
hide the Properties panel in order to achieve

02:58: the final effect.

03:00: And just to see what we've been able to 
achieve over the course of this project, I'm going

03:04: to double-click on the dude thumbnail here in 
order to open up the original Smart Object,

03:09: and I'll zoom in as well.

03:10: Then I'll switch back to the composition at 
hand, zoom in it too, and press Shift+F in

03:15: order to switch to the Full Screen mode and 
now I'll go ahead and Shift+Spacebar+Drag

03:20: these images to scroll both of them.

03:22: So, this is the image as it appeared after 
we corrected for the lens distortion, and

03:27: this is the final version of the image; 
thanks to the combination of Shadows/Highlights,

03:31: Gaussian Blur, High Pass, and a Filter 
Mask working together here inside Photoshop.


 ** Using Curves

00:00: As you may recall the luminance of a pixel 
is its brightness, from black to white.

00:06: In previous courses I showed you how to 
adjust luminance using the very simple brightness

00:10: contrast and the more complicated levels.

00:13: And now, in this chapter, I'll introduce you to 
the most capable luminance adjustment command

00:18: in all of Photoshop, which 
goes simply by the name Curves.

00:23: As I did back in Chapter 12, when I showed you 
levels, I'll stand in for the problem image.

00:28: But this time I am too high contrast, my 
shadows are filled in, my highlights are blown out.

00:34: You can't fix this kind of problem 
with levels, but you can with curves.

00:39: The curves command takes the Histogram, which 
is that Bar Graph of luminance levels from

00:43: black to white, and scales it to fit inside this 
square graph, which is pretty intimidating, I grant you.

00:51: But it means that you can map any luminance 
level to another one which is to say you have

00:55: complete control over the 
brightness and contrast of an image.

01:00: To simplify things I'll go ahead and hide the 
Histogram, and we'll focus on this diagonal

01:05: line which is the curve itself.

01:08: I know, it doesn't look like a 
curve, but it will in a moment.

01:12: The current state of the image is the horizontal axis,
with black on the left and white on the right.

01:18: The modified state of the image is the vertical axis,
with black at the bottom and white at the top.

01:24: So this straight diagonal line indicates no 
change, black is black and white is white,

01:30: same goes for everything in between.

01:33: Of course, you want to make a change, that's 
why you are here, which means you need to

01:37: set a point on the curve and 
drag it to a new location.

01:41: Let's say I want to brighten my midtones.

01:43: I'd click to add a point to the center 
of the line, then I drag it upward.

01:48: Now we have a curve.

01:50: My medium grays have become brighter but so 
do all the other luminance levels in between,

01:55: except for black and white.

01:57: which remained fixed.

01:59: But the midtones really aren't my problem.

02:02: My problem are the shadows down 
here and the highlights up here.

02:06: So I will set a shadow point 
here and then I will drag it up.

02:11: Notice that elevates the shadows, the midtones are 
protected by this point and then the highlights

02:16: bend down but only slightly.

02:19: We need to darken the highlights more.

02:21: So I'll set a point here and 
then I'll drag it downward.

02:25: Now we have an inverted S curve, 
and look at my highlights and shadows.

02:29: They are in very better shape.

02:31: I can't promise to make you fall in love with 
curves, it's a graph after all, but you will

02:37: learn how to make it work 
in the following movies.

 ** Introducing the Curves adjustment

00:00: In this movie I will introduce you to the 
Curves adjustment, because when you first

00:03: encounter it, it's a little 
bit of a head scratcher.

00:05: And by way of example I have opened one of 
those black and white variations that we created

00:10: back in Chapter 20 of the Intermediate Course and 
while I think the world of the black and white

00:15: adjustment here, if I have one complaint it's 
that it tends to deliver images that lack heft.

00:21: That is to say the shadows and even the midtones in 
the case of this image just aren't dark enough.

00:28: What I want is an effect 
more like this one here.

00:31: The difference between this dramatic unambiguous 
black and white image and the one we saw

00:35: a moment ago is that the one we are looking 
at now includes a Curves adjustment and the

00:40: one we created in Chapter 20 does not.

00:42: So let's start things off by getting a 
sense of when you want to use Curves.

00:46: It's basically that luminance adjustment 
command that you go to when Brightness/Contrast

00:51: and Levels just don't do the trick.

00:54: So I will start by showing you what we can 
do with Levels and Brightness/Contrast where

00:58: this image is concerned.

00:59: I will go up to the Image menu and choose a 
Duplicate command and then I will go ahead

01:04: and call this new version of the 
image Levels and zoom in on it.

01:07: Then I will drop down to the black/white icon at the 
bottom of the Layers panel and choose Levels command.

01:13: I am going to go and expand the Properties 
panel as well so that I can see the full width

01:17: of the histogram like so.

01:19: Presumably, what I do is I would, for 
example Alt+Drag or Opt+Drag this black slider

01:25: triangle in order to preview the clip pixels 
on screen and notice that they're appearing

01:30: in black and white as 
opposed to the various colors.

01:33: That's because all of the colors in this particular 
image have been converted to shades of gray.

01:38: So at a black point of about 10 we are seeing 
probably about as much clipping as we want.

01:42: So we will go ahead and release.

01:43: Now I could do the same with the white triangle here; 
I could Alt+Drag or Opt+Drag it over to say 240.

01:51: But if I do that I'm going to blow some 
highlights and I am going to overly brighten this image.

01:55: I'm not interested in adding more brightness to it.

01:58: So I will just go ahead and 
restore that value to 255.

02:01: That leaves me with just one more point 
of control and that's the Gamma value.

02:06: So I will go ahead and click in it and press 
Shift+Down Arrow three times in a row to reduce

02:11: that value to 0.7.

02:13: That's about as much work as 
I can get done with Levels.

02:16: So let's go ahead and close the 
Properties panels so we can see what we have got.

02:19: Things are in pretty good shape.

02:21: We have some very dark shadows; that's good.

02:23: The midtones are looking okay.

02:25: But if you compare that to what I was able 
to achieve with curves which is this image

02:29: here you can see that we have got a lot 
more detail going on inside the hair.

02:33: We've got much better shading and detail 
inside the flesh and we've got all kinds of great

02:38: shadow detail as well.

02:40: So while Levels is pretty good, it's not 
nearly as great as what I am hoping for.

02:45: So now let's see what we can 
achieve using Brightness/Contrast.

02:47: I will go ahead and 
switchback to my starter image.

02:49: Go up to the Image menu, choose the Duplicate command,
and call this one Brightness contrast, of course.

02:56: Then click OK in order to create the new 
version of the image, zoom on in as well, drop down

03:00: to the black white icon at the bottom of 
Layers panel and choose Brightness/Contrast.

03:05: Then I will go ahead and crank that Contrast 
value up to its absolute maximum of 100,

03:11: which does a great job of making the shadows very 
dark, the highlights get overly light in my

03:16: opinion, however nothing ends up 
clipping inside the image. So that's good.

03:21: Then I'll take that Brightness value down 
to let's say -40 in order to tame some of

03:26: those highlights and bring 
the midtones down as well.

03:29: Again, things look pretty good and you might 
argue compared with Levels that Brightness/Contrast

03:36: ends up performing little better, 
but I am not so sure actually.

03:39: But again we are losing detail inside of the 
hair and inside of the shadows particularly

03:44: when compared to that final version that we are 
going to achieve using the Curves adjustment.

03:50: So let's see what Curves looks like.

03:51: I'm going to switchover to that starter once 
again and I am going to drop down to the black/white

03:56: icon at the bottom of the panel and you can 
see that the Curves command immediately follows

04:01: Levels and Brightness/Contrast.

04:02: It really does go like this.

04:04: Try Brightness/Contrast first, 
if that does the trick, great.

04:07: Try Levels second, if 
that does the trick, great.

04:10: And if neither of them work,
then move on to Curves.

04:13: Exposure is never useful in my opinion.

04:16: I am going to go ahead and 
choose the Curves command.

04:19: Notice that you end up 
seeing this big square graph.

04:21: Well, even though it's pretty darn unfamiliar, 
a lot of the stuff we are seeing is very similar

04:26: to what's going on with Levels.

04:28: For example, the centerpiece of this graph 
is a histogram and even though it looks like

04:33: a squished histogram at first, it's actually 
exactly the same width as the histogram that

04:38: appears along with levels adjustment.

04:40: The difference is that the Curves histogram is 
stretched vertically in order to fit inside

04:45: of square, which is perfectly fine, by the 
way, because after all these vertical lines

04:50: inside of the graph, they 
don't represent absolute numbers.

04:53: In other words, this one right here isn't 
a heap of all of the pixels that are that

04:59: dark shade of gray.

05:00: Rather, those are the number of dark gray pixels 
when compared with these very light gray pixels

05:06: represented by this tall 
line on right-hand side.

05:10: We've also got a black 
triangle and a white triangle.

05:13: They let you modify the black point 
and white point inside the image.

05:16: Then we have this diagonal line which is the 
curve itself which may seem odd, because after

05:22: all it starts off as a straight line.

05:24: You make this line curve by clicking 
somewhere in the graph in order to set a point.

05:30: So in my case I've clicked 
right there at the center.

05:33: So what I'm seeing here is that I've set 
a point and 128 which is medium gray.

05:37: So you may recall 0 is black, 255 is white.

05:41: So right there in the center is 128.

05:43: I am mapping shades of gray that were 
formerly 128 to an output level of 128 once again.

05:50: So I am not changing them at this point 
until I drag that point to another location.

05:54: So let's say I drag the point directly up.

05:57: Now I am mapping an input 
of 128 to an output of 171.

06:01: So all the shades of gray that were formerly 
128 are now being mapped to 171, which of

06:05: course is lighter gray.

06:07: The other shades of gray move along with, 
because after all the line is gradually tapering

06:12: as you can see here.

06:13: You can also drag this point down if you 
like in order to darken the shades of gray.

06:19: For example, if I take this value down to 
let's say 86, I am mapping what were formerly

06:24: medium grays to dark grays.

06:26: If you just drag a point up and down like, 
this is very much like modifying the Gamma

06:30: value when working with Levels.

06:33: If I want to achieve an effect that's very much 
like what we saw with Levels just a moment ago,

06:37: then I would also press the Alt key or the 
Option key on the Mac and drag this Black

06:42: slider triangle, so you can preview your clipping 
inside curve just as you can when working with Levels.

06:47: I can see that some of those shadows are 
clipping over on the left-hand side of the image.

06:51: So I'll go and release.

06:53: So at this point I am saying anything that 
has a luminous level of 10 or darker is going

06:57: to map to an output of 0, which is black.

07:01: Let's go ahead and hide the Properties panel 
for a moment so we can compare the effects.

07:05: This is what we're able to achieve with curves so far 
bear in mind and this is what we achieved with levels.

07:12: If anything the Curves adjustment is already 
better even though it's remarkably similar,

07:16: the Curves adjustment has slightly better 
detail going on inside the shadows and a bit

07:20: more detail inside of the highlights as well.

07:24: So there's your introduction.

07:25: But here's the thing.

07:26: If we were able to achieve an effect just 
as good as anything we might achieve with

07:30: Levels that easily with Curves, just imagine 
how much better we can do in the next movie.

 ** Adding and editing points on a curve

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to 
add and edit points inside curves.

00:04: I'll start things off here by double-clicking 
on the thumbnail for the Curves 1 layer; that

00:08: brings up Curves inside the Properties panel.

00:11: And I'm also going to drag this black triangle 
back to the far left-hand side of the graph,

00:15: and that's because you can typically achieve 
more control over your shadows in particular

00:20: by adding points along the left-hand portion 
of the graph, and I'll show you what I mean

00:24: in just a moment.

00:25: But first, I'm going to scroll the image over 
so that I can better keep track of the woman

00:28: in the foreground here.

00:29: And now I could just click at some point inside of the 
shadow region here in order to set a point like so.

00:36: And so in my case I've set a point at Input 
32 and Output 16, so I'm taking any shades

00:42: of gray that formerly had a luminance 
level of 32 and I'm darkening them to 16.

00:48: And that's just by virtue of the 
natural curvature of the graph so far.

00:51: All right, let's say I 
want to modify that point.

00:53: Well, I could drag it of course if I want 
to, or I can modify the numerical values,

00:58: but typically the easiest way to 
work is to press the arrow keys.

01:02: So if you press the Left Arrow Key, you're 
going to nudge the Input value down,

01:06: and if you press the Right Arrow Key, you're 
going to nudge the Input value up.

01:09: Now, at first that might not make any sense, 
why left for down and right for up?

01:14: And that's because you're moving the point 
back and forth to either left or the right.

01:19: And the more you work with it, the more 
you'll get a sense of what's going on there.

01:23: And so I'm going to go ahead and 
scoot this Input value over to 30.

01:27: And then if I press the Up Arrow Key, 
I'm going to raise the Output value.

01:31: And if I press the Down Arrow Key,
I'm going to lower that value.

01:34: And in my case I want to take that value down 
pretty darn far, to an Output level of 10.

01:40: So that darkens up the shadows considerably, 
but it also takes away some of the detail

01:44: inside of the hair.

01:46: So what I need to do is lift the brightness of the 
lightest hairs, but first I need to find them.

01:51: And the easiest way to find luminance levels 
inside of an image is to take advantage of

01:56: the bouncing ball, and here's what I mean.

01:59: You switch over to your Target Adjustment 
tool, so that same tool we saw at work with

02:03: Hue/Saturation, and Black/White is 
available to us with curves as well.

02:08: And by the way, if you loaded dekeKeys, 
you can get to it by pressing the K key.

02:12: And then notice, I want you to watch this 
dark section of the curve right there, you'll

02:16: notice the ball bouncing back and forth as 
soon as I move my cursor over the dark hairs.

02:21: And I want to emphasize, I'm not dragging, 
I don't have the mouse button down,

02:25: I'm just moving the cursor around.

02:27: And so right about this point I think 
I'll click in order to set a point.

02:32: So notice as soon as you click inside the 
image, you've set a point in the graph, and

02:35: in my case the Input value is 61 and the 
Output is 27, I want to go ahead and back off

02:41: that Input value to 60 and then I'm going to take 
the Output value up by pressing the Up Arrow

02:46: Key several times until I get a value of 35.

02:50: That ends up brightening that shadow detail inside 
of the hair and elsewhere throughout the image.

02:57: And something that's very important, by the 
way, if you want to get a sense of what the

02:59: values actually are, if you're not seeing 
your values change properly, that's because

03:04: you've left your cursor 
outside here inside the image.

03:07: And so for example, I'm seeing Input 172 and 
Output 134, that doesn't have anything to

03:12: do with the selected point; that has 
everything to do with the location of my cursor.

03:17: So you need to move the cursor back 
inside the panel, like so. All right.

03:21: Now, I'm going to switch to the next point, 
the one that I've already created in advance

03:25: here at the center of the curve.

03:27: And I can get to it just by clicking on it 
of course, but when you click on a point,

03:31: it's very easy to nudge it, to move it to a 
new location, so oftentimes it's preferable

03:36: to cycle to a point from the keyboard.

03:38: And here's how you do it, you press the Plus 
(+) key to advance to the next point like so.

03:43: So if I press the Plus (+) key a second time,
I would advance to that final point.

03:47: if I press it again, I'll advance to the very 
first point in the graph, and so forth.

03:52: If you press the minus (-) key, 
you'll back up through the points.

03:56: And I love this shortcut, because notice if 
I click on the panel, then I deselect all

04:00: the points and now I can make any one of the 
points active anytime I like just by pressing

04:05: the Plus (+) key, and that will go ahead and 
select the very first point in the graph,

04:09: that is the point in the lower left corner, 
and then I'll advance onward. All right.

04:13: So I'll press Plus (+) enough times to get 
to that center point right there, and then

04:17: I'm going to press Shift+Right Arrow to move 
that Input value in the increments of 10,

04:23: and eventually I want that value to be 155.

04:27: And then I'm going to press Shift-Up Arrow 
a couple of times there in order to raise

04:31: that Output value ultimately to a 110, so 
you may have to press the Up Arrow Key a few

04:36: times by itself as well.

04:38: And that ends up brightening the midtones just a bit.

04:41: And then finally, I want to brighten the highlights 
a little, because they've gotten dragged down

04:44: by this midpoint here.

04:46: And so once again, using the Target Adjustment 
tool, I'll click inside a highlight inside

04:51: the eye, for example, in order to set a point,
in my case at 225, with an Output of 206.

04:58: And in order to see those values, you're going 
to have to move your cursor inside the panel,

05:03: and then I'll press Shift+Right Arrow in 
order to nudge that Input value to 235, and I'll

05:07: press Shift+Up Arrow a couple of times, and then Up 
Arrow a little more to set the Output value to 230.

05:15: And so just so you can get a sense of what 
kind of difference I made there, I'll go ahead

05:18: and press the Ctrl key or the Cmd key on 
the Mac and click on that highlight point

05:23: in order to delete it.

05:24: So Cmd+Click or Ctrl+
Click on a point deletes it.

05:27: This is how the image looked without that 
point, and then if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z

05:31: again, this is what the image 
looks like with this point.

05:34: All right, that's the extent 
of our graph right there.

05:37: So I'm going to go ahead and hide the panel and 
then zoom out and scroll over just a little bit.

05:41: And so just so you have a sense of what we've 
accomplished, I'll turn off that Curves 1 layer.

05:45: This is the image as it appeared when we 
finished working on it back in Chapter 20, and this

05:50: is the new deeper, darker, more dramatic image, 
thanks to our addition of a Curves Adjustment.

05:55: Now, I just want to say one more thing before 
we quit this movie here, even though I just

06:01: got done closing the Curves panel, my Target 
Adjustment tool remains selected, and that

06:06: can get you in trouble or at least provide 
unexpected results if you, for example, think

06:10: that the Rectangular Marquee tool is selected 
and you begin dragging inside the image and

06:15: you get an effect like this one here.

06:18: In which case just go ahead and press Ctrl+Z 
or Cmd+Z on the Mac to undo that change,

06:22: and then press the M key to switch 
back to the Rectangular Marquee.

 ** Winning Curves tips and tricks

00:00: In this movie, I'll share with you a few tricks that 
should make your life easier when working with curves.

00:05: You will notice that I've gone 
ahead and renamed my layer contrast.

00:07: I'll double-click on it to bring up curves 
inside the Properties panel, and just to make

00:12: sure that I'm protected, because I am 
going to make a bunch of modifications here.

00:15: I am going to go up to the flyout menu and 
choose Save Curves Preset and I will go ahead

00:20: and name this file Black & white heft for example.

00:23: Make sure to save your preset to the default 
Curves folder which is the subfolder someplace

00:27: in your hard drive and then click the Save 
button, and you'll see Black & white heft

00:32: in my case listed among your Presets, which means 
you can come back to this graph anytime you like.

00:37: Now it's showing you how you can press the 
Control key or the Command key on the Mac and

00:41: click on a point in order to delete it.

00:43: I'll go ahead and press Ctrl+Z or 
Cmd+Z on the Mac to undo that change.

00:47: What happens when you Alt+Click 
or Opt+Click or Shift+Click?

00:51: Well, if you Alt+Click inside the graph you 
are going to increase the number of gridlines,

00:55: that would be an Opt+Click on the Mac.

00:56: If you Alt+Click or Opt+Click again, 
you will reduce the number of gridlines.

00:59: And all that is, is a preference.

01:01: This is not a snapping grid.

01:03: So it won't help you nail 
the location of points.

01:05: If you Shift+Click on points, you will 
select multiple points at the time.

01:09: So I'm going to click and then Shift+Click 
on these three points right there.

01:13: For example, I will drag them upward and 
typically this is what you want to do.

01:16: If I were brightening the darkest colors for 
example, I would drag these points upward

01:22: or I could darken them by dragging downward.

01:25: You typically don't want to drag back and 
forth, because in my case if drag to the left,

01:29: I end up losing some of those points and I have to 
drag back to the right again in order to regain them.

01:35: What you most typically do hear--I'll go ahead 
and press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on the Mac to

01:39: reset those points--is just select a handful of 
points and then nudge them from the keyboard.

01:44: So if I wanted to brighten my shadows and 
midtones I would press the Up Arrow key a

01:48: few times in a row and notice 
that the Output value now reads 8.

01:52: That is not an absolute 
luminance level as in almost black.

01:55: That is a relative luminance level meaning that we 
have brightened all three of these points by eight.

02:01: All right.

02:02: So far I've showed you how to set and modify 
points on a curve, but you can also draw a

02:07: custom curve graph using this Pencil right here.

02:10: So for example I could go ahead and just draw a 
curve across the graph and presumably you're

02:16: going to start somewhere down left and move 
your way up right, because if you go in the

02:20: opposite direction, for example from up left to down 
right, you'll end up inverting the image like so.

02:28: You can also draw crazy graphs if you want to.

02:30: I will go ahead and turn off these two 
grayscale layers right there so that we can see curves

02:36: applied to the full-color image, and now 
notice if I draw something along these lines,

02:42: I'm creating what's known as an arbitrary map, 
which among other things can end up generating

02:48: psychedelic effects like these here, and you're 
probably not going to take advantage of this

02:52: very often, but you may sometimes find these 
sorts of arbitrary maps to be useful when

02:57: working with masks.

02:58: Now if your curve ends up having a bunch of 
gaps in it as mine does or it ends up spiking

03:04: in certain locations, you can soften the 
transitions by clicking on the Smooth button.

03:09: So notice each time I click Smooth, I end 
up smoothing out my graph like so and then

03:14: I could decide this wants to go back up and 
then I could click Smooth a few more times.

03:19: Now a more practical way to take advantage of 
the Pencil combined with Smooth is to Shift+Click

03:25: inside the graph.

03:26: Let me show you what that looks like.

03:27: I'll go and turn those two grayscale layers 
back on and then I'll click in the bottom

03:32: left corner and Shift+Click at this location 
here and Shift+Click again, and notice each

03:37: time I Shift+Click I end up connecting 
my click points with straight segments.

03:43: So that's a quick way to roughen a graph, 
that ends up giving us this posterization

03:47: as you can see here inside 
the image window, however.

03:50: So get rid of the posterization and smooth 
out the transitions you click on the Smooth

03:55: button, probably three or four 
or even five times in a row.

04:00: Now the great thing about working this way 
is you don't have to mess with the values

04:04: and Photoshop will actually create the 
values for you if you just go ahead and click on

04:08: this little Points button there, notice Photoshop 
adds points to the graph, automatically sets

04:13: the Input and Output values, 
and you're done. All right.

04:16: Another thing to note, if I grab the Target 
Adjustment tool, I was showing you how if

04:20: you move your cursor in the image, and my 
cursor is in the woman's forehead right here,

04:25: you can see the bouncing ball, in my case 
in the upper right portion of the graph

04:29: and if you click, you end up 
setting a point to that location.

04:32: Well, you also have three other graphs to work 
with when you're working inside of an RGB image.

04:37: You can independently modify the 
Red, Green, and Blue channels.

04:41: So there might be times where you want to set, 
instead of a composite point as we created

04:45: just a moment ago, a channel by channel point.

04:48: So in my case, let's say I move down her 
brow here so I can get a kind of darker color,

04:53: and right about there I will press the Ctrl+Shift 
keys or Cmd+Shift on the Mac and I'll click.

05:00: And that goes ahead and sets a point inside 
of each one of the independent channels.

05:05: So notice if I switch to the Red channel, 
I've got a point right there, and so I can

05:08: press the Up Arrow key to add a little bit 
of redness to my otherwise grayscale image

05:13: and now I'll switch to the Blue channel and 
press the Escape key so that the menu is no

05:18: longer active and press the Down Arrow key 
in order to achieve a kind of Sepia effect there,

05:22: and then I might switch over to the 
Green channel and press Escape once again

05:27: and then press the Up Arrow key, maybe just a 
couple of times so that I don't end up making

05:32: the image look too yellow and I 
achieve this effect here. All right.

05:35: Now I am going to switch back to the 
Composite version of the image like so, and you can

05:39: see those channel by channel curves represented in 
Red, Green, and Blue inside the composite graph.

05:46: All right.

05:47: Let's end things with a look at what happens 
when you're working inside of a grayscale image.

05:51: So for the moment I am going to go ahead and 
click on this Curves layer here inside the

05:54: Layers panel, and press the Backspace key 
or the Delete key on the Mac to get rid of it,

05:58: and then I'll go up to the Image menu, 
choose mode, and choose Grayscale and I will

06:03: a get series of alert messages asking me 
if I want to rasterize my Smart Object.

06:08: I do, so I'll click the Rasterize button.

06:10: Do I want to get rid of my 
adjustment layers or merge them?

06:13: I want to merge them, because 
otherwise I'll lose those adjustments.

06:17: And then finally, do I want to 
discard the color information?

06:19: I do, so I will click Discard and I am left 
with a single layer as well as the single

06:25: channel gray here inside the Channels panel.

06:27: Now if I dropdown to the Black/White icon 
and I choose the Curves command, you can see

06:32: here in the Properties panel 
that everything is backward.

06:34: We have the white triangle on the left-hand 
side and the black triangle on the right side.

06:39: And the reason for this is these guys no longer represent 
Luminance levels, instead they represent ink values.

06:46: So if I were to click on this lower left 
point, you can see that the value is 0.

06:51: By that it means 0% ink which is paper white 
and if I press the Plus (+) key in order to

06:56: advance to the upper right point, its 
value is 100 meaning a 100% ink, so black.

07:03: What that does is it ends up just messing with the 
way your brain works inside Photoshop in my opinion.

07:09: I can go ahead and reload that preset I created 
a moment ago by choosing Black & white heft,

07:15: but now the whole thing is 
upside down and backwards.

07:18: So I'm raising the points in order to darken 
those shadows in the upper right region of

07:23: the graph and everything that's occurring with the 
highlights is in the down left region of the graph.

07:29: If you don't like to work that way then I 
have to admit I don't, because everything

07:33: else in Photoshop is based on luminance.

07:36: Then you can click on the flyout menu icon 
and choose Curves Display Options and then

07:41: switch Show Amount of from Pigment/Ink% to 
Light (0-255) and that restores the graph

07:48: to its more familiar behavior.

07:50: Then click OK, and by the way, this will change the 
graph for all future grayscale images as well.

07:56: If you work in CMYK and you prefer to work 
with luminance, as we have so far, then you

08:02: would want to run through those 
same steps with the CMYK image.

08:06: Those are a few tips and tricks for working 
with Curve Adjustments here inside Photoshop.

 ** Correcting a challenging image

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to use 
Curves to correct the most challenging of full-color

00:05: photographs, specifically, we will be 
starting with this absurdly high contrast image in

00:10: which the foreground subject could not be 
darker and the background is so bright, we

00:15: can barely make out any detail and we will adjust 
the image so it comes out looking like this.

00:21: With this wonderful detail inside the barn, 
this contouring inside the snow and even some

00:26: variation in the sky and if nothing else, 
this is proof of the shear power of Curves.

00:31: It really is that one command that can correct 
the luminance of just about any photograph.

00:37: So I will go and switch back to my original 
photo here and I'll go up to the Image menu

00:42: for a moment and choose Adjustments and by 
way of a reminder, if you loaded dekeKeys,

00:46: you will see the Brightness/Contrast is a 
keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+/(slash) or Cmd+/(slash)

00:51: and then we have the factory default shortcuts 
of Ctrl+L or Cmd+L and Ctrl+M or Cmd+M

00:57: for Levels and Curves respectively.

00:59: Now of course, those apply static adjustments, 
but if you loaded dekeKeys, then you can add

01:03: the Shift key to create the 
corresponding Adjustment layer.

01:07: So Ctrl+Shift+/ or Cmd+Shift+/ gives you 
Brightness Contrast layer Ctrl+Shift+L or

01:12: Cmd+Shift+ L gives you the Levels 
layer and Ctrl+Shift+M or Cmd+Shift+M.

01:16: gives you a Curves layer.

01:18: Now just looking at this image you should 
know that it's a job for Curves, and that

01:22: is because it is so high contrast.

01:25: The Levels Adjustment, while great for bringing 
out the detail in a washed out image where

01:30: you need to increase the contrast, does not 
allow you with any degree of control to reduce

01:35: the contrast of the image.

01:37: Whereas Brightness/Contrast, if I was to 
press Ctrl+Shift+/ or Cmd+Shift+/ on the Mac

01:43: in order to create a Brightness/Contrast layer, 
and call it let's say reduced contrast, does

01:47: not go far enough.

01:48: So you could reduce the contrast value to 
its absolute minimum, to bring out some of

01:52: the detail in the barn and then you would 
have to increase the brightness as well,

01:57: to, let's say 30, and that does a decent job of 
bringing out the detail in that barn, but

02:02: it wipes out the background, because we 
had to ratchet up that brightness value.

02:06: So it's just not going to 
get us anywhere we want.

02:09: I will press the Backspace key or the Delete 
key on the Mac to get rid of that layer,

02:13: and instead, I'll press Ctrl+
Shift+M or Cmd+Shift+M.

02:16: Again, this assumes that you loaded dekeKeys 
in order to create a New Curves layer and

02:20: I'll call it reduced contrast as well.

02:23: All right, now that I have the Properties 
panel open, I am going to take advantage of

02:27: the Target Adjustment tool.

02:28: So go ahead and click on it or if you loaded 
dekeKeys you can press the K key and I am

02:33: going to zoom in on this little knot on the 
side of the barn, and then I will find a point

02:37: in the upper right corner here.

02:39: You'll notice over in the Curves panel that 
the Input value is reading 19 and now I'll

02:44: click and drag and you drag down with the 
cursor in order to darken the colors,

02:50: you drag up, in order to brighten the colors.

02:52: I want to take that Output value 
to about 36 as you see here.

02:57: So you'd have to move your cursor into the 
panel to see the result of your work and

03:01: I really want the Input value to be 20.

03:04: So I'll press the Right Arrow key to make it so.

03:06: So we are mapping luminance levels that were 
formerly 20, to 36, which means that we are

03:11: brightening not only the 
shadows, but the image overall.

03:14: All right, now I am going to scroll over to 
a portion of the snow below this section of

03:19: the barn here, and I'm trying to find a very 
bright color, something around 230 will do,

03:25: so you can see at this point here, my cursor 
is in the lower left section of the screen,

03:29: and my Input value is to 230 at the bottom of 
the Properties panel and now I'll go ahead

03:34: and click and drag down in order to darken 
the details inside the snow, so we can see

03:40: a little bit of that contouring, and 
I'll take that Output value down to 260.

03:45: So if I bring my cursor back into the panel, 
you can see Input is 230, Output 216 and finally,

03:52: I want to brighten my quarter 
tones just a little bit here.

03:55: So I am going to scroll over to another location.

03:58: On the right side of the barn, we have a little bit 
of snow and I'm looking for an Input that's 195.

04:03: I am finding one that's 192, so 
that's probably a good place to start.

04:08: And notice that Output is showing as 174, 
because of the shape of my curve so far.

04:12: I want to brighten those values, so I will 
go ahead and drag up until the Output value

04:17: reads 183, is what I'm looking for.

04:20: And again, if you don't quite get these values,
if you're hovering around inside the image

04:24: and you can't match my Input values and 
so forth, you can just dial these in.

04:29: So I will move my cursor back into the panel.

04:30: In my case, I need to press the Right Arrow 
key a few times in order to raise the Input

04:35: value to 195 and then I will press the Up Arrow 
key in order to increase my Output value to 183.

04:41: All right, now I will go ahead and hide the 
Properties panel and press Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0

04:46: on the Mac to zoom out.

04:48: So let's see what we've managed to achieve here.

04:50: This is the original version of the image 
and this is the image, thanks to Curves,

04:55: and notice that we've brightened the barn 
just every bit as much as we were able to

04:59: with Brightness/Contrast.

05:00: But we've also reduced the luminance of 
the snow, thereby increasing its contrast.

05:06: Now I want to add a little bit of color to 
the image, and I'm not going to do so subtly.

05:10: We are just going to amp the colors up like 
crazy, by pressing the Alt key or the Option

05:15: key on the Mac, clicking the black/white icon 
and choosing Vibrance, or if you loaded dekeKeys,

05:20: you can just press Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+Shift+V
on the Mac and I'll go ahead and Name this

05:25: layer superblaster, because we are going to be 
blasting those colors and I will click OK.

05:31: We don't need this panel to be so large this 
time around, so I will go ahead and shrink it,

05:35: and then I'll click in the Saturation 
value and press Shift+Up Arrow four times

05:39: in a row to increase the Saturation to 40 
and then I'll press the Tab key to advance

05:44: to the Vibrance value and crank it up to its 
absolute maximum of 100, and we end up with

05:50: this effect here.

05:51: All right, now I'll once again hide the Properties 
panel and just so we can see what we've achieved

05:55: over the course of this movie, I'll Alt+Click or 
Opt+Click on the eye in front of the background.

06:00: This is the original version of the image 
and if I Alt+Click or Opt+Click again,

06:05: this is our corrected version.

06:07: Thanks to the power of Curves and Vibrance 
working together, and it really is amazing,

06:11: just how much luminance detail is inside 
this image, when it looked so bad in the first

06:17: place and ends up coming out so great.

06:21: But not great enough, because I'd still like 
to sync some of the contrast associated with

06:26: the snow and so I will show you how to 
selectively modify the luminance of the highlights

06:30: in the next movie.


 ** Selecting and darkening highlights

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to select 
the highlights in this image using a Luminance

00:04: Mask and then we'll dramatically 
darken those highlights using curves.

00:09: So for starters, I am going to Alt+click or Opt+click 
on the eye in front of the Background layer,

00:13: so we can restore the original high contrast 
version of this photo which is going

00:17: to work beautifully for masking this dark 
barn away from this bright sky and snow.

00:23: So really the image is going to select itself.

00:25: I'll switch over to the Channels panel and we are 
looking for the highest contrast of the channels.

00:31: The Red channel is going to be 
brightest because the barn is made of wood.

00:34: The Green channel is going to be slightly darker 
and the Blue channel is going to be darker still.

00:39: So obviously, the Blue 
channel is the one we want.

00:42: To load it up as the selection, press the 
Ctrl key or the Cmd key on the Mac and

00:46: click on the Blue channel.

00:48: Then switch back to the RGB image, return to 
the Layers panel and Alt+click or Opt+click

00:53: on the eye in front of the Background 
to restore all the layers.

00:57: Then assuming you loaded dekeKeys, press Ctrl+
Shift+M or Cmd+Shift+M on the Mac in order to

01:02: create a new curves layer and I'm going to 
call this layer darken snow because that's

01:07: its purpose, and then I'll click the OK button.

01:10: And notice that Photoshop goes ahead and automatically 
converts that selection to a layer mask so

01:15: we are actually seeing the original Blue channel 
inside that layer mask which means we'll apply

01:20: the Curves Adjustment to the 
highlights and nothing more. All right.

01:23: Now I'll expand the size of my Curves 
panel, so I can see the entire graph.

01:27: And this time around, you don't need 
to use the Target Adjustment tool.

01:31: I am just looking for an Input of 165 which 
is right about there and then I'm going to

01:38: click and drag down.

01:40: So ultimately the Input value wants to be 165 
and then the Output value wants to be 85

01:45: and you can just drag to that location 
if you like or you can create the point and

01:51: then nudge it from the keyboard, but again 
Input 165 dropping down to an Output of 85.

01:57: So we're darkening all of those 
colors dramatically. All right.

02:01: Now I'll go ahead and hide the Properties panel.

02:04: Now if I turn off this layer for a moment, 
you can see that I've managed to not only

02:08: darken up the snow by I had darken the barn 
as well and you can watch it brighten up as

02:12: soon as I turn layer the layer off and then 
if I turn the layer back on, you see that

02:17: barn get darker, you see the Background get darker, 
but the Background is not getting dark enough.

02:22: So what I need to do is increase 
the contrast of this layer mask.

02:26: So I'll Alt+click on it or Opt+click on the 
layer Mask thumbnail here inside the Layers panel

02:30: to view it independently of the rest of 
the image and then the great tool for increasing

02:35: contrast inside Photoshop is the Levels command.

02:39: We have to apply a static version of the command 
because you can't apply an adjustment layer to a mask.

02:44: So go up to the Image menu, choose Adjustments 
and then choose Levels or you can just press

02:49: Ctrl+L or Cmd+L on the Mac.

02:51: And you'll see if I move this dialog box over 
to the right, there is our barn over on the

02:56: left-hand side of the histogram and there is our 
snow and sky over on the far right-hand side.

03:02: So because this is a mask, I want to 
clip away all of that sky and snow.

03:06: So I am going to drag this white point 
triangle over to 200 which tells Photoshop to take

03:11: everything that has a Luminance Level of 200 
or brighter and make it absolutely white.

03:17: Then I'll drag the black triangle all the 
way over to let's say 90 is what I am looking

03:23: for and that tells Photoshop to take 
everything with a Luminance Level of 90 or darker and

03:29: make it absolutely black which is why the 
barn is turning nearly completely black and

03:35: the sky and the snow are 
turning completely white.

03:37: We are turning some of the weeds black 
as well as you can see. All right.

03:41: Now go ahead and click OK to apply that 
modification and then Alt+click or Opt+click on the

03:46: layer Mask in order to 
return to the full color image.

03:50: So to see the difference, I'll 
press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on the Mac.

03:53: This is what the barn and sky looked like 
before we modified that layer mask and this

03:57: is how the barn and sky look now.

03:59: And if I turn this layer off and then back on, 
you can see that the barn is barely changing

04:04: at all, but the snow and sky 
are becoming much darker.

04:08: And while that's a lot better, we have got 
a lot more detail inside the snow and sky

04:12: for example, the composite 
image is by no means perfect.

04:15: I'll go ahead and zoom in to this lower right 
corner of the image and you can see that the

04:19: snow and sky are turning kind of purplish 
on this, especially in the shadow regions

04:24: and we've got a ton of posterization 
happening at the edges of the mask.

04:29: And I'll show you how to fix both problems, by 
modifying the mask and adjusting the curves

04:35: on a channel-by-channel 
basis in the next movie.


 ** Neutralizing colors and smoothing transitions

00:00: In this movie, we'll get rid of that purple 
colorcast and the snow and sky by adjusting

00:05: our Curves Settings on a 
channel by channel basis.

00:07: And you can see just what a difference we're 
going to make here by switching to the final

00:12: version of the image, in which both 
the snow and sky are perfectly neutral.

00:18: And here's how that works.

00:19: I'll go ahead and switch to our composition 
in progress, and then I'll double-click on

00:23: the thumbnail for the darken snow 
layer to bring up the Properties panel.

00:26: And I'm going to go ahead and zoom 
in on a region of purplish snow.

00:30: And then I'll select my Gray Eyedropper, 
which lets me do the same thing it does when

00:35: I'm working with Levels, that is you click 
inside the image to make a color neutral.

00:40: And then I'll click on what appears to be a 
sort of purplish color there in the snow.

00:46: And that does make the image more neutral, 
however, it appears to me as if I'm making

00:51: the image sort of green.

00:53: And in order to sort of test if I've gotten 
things right here, I can drag the darken snow

00:58: layer below superblaster, and that way the 
effects of this adjustment will get exaggerated.

01:04: So notice as soon as darken snow is below 
superblaster, I'm increasing the Saturation

01:09: and Vibrance of these colors like crazy, and I 
can see that, yes, my snow is now super green.

01:15: All right.

01:15: So notice now here inside the Curves panel that 
I can see some independent channel adjustments

01:20: in the form of these green and blue 
curves; you may see a red curve as well.

01:24: So obviously the main culprit is the green 
curve, so I'll go ahead and switch from the

01:28: RGB composite to the Green Channel.

01:30: And on the PC I have to press the Escape 
key in order to deactivate that menu.

01:36: Then I'll press the Plus (+) key a couple of 
times in order to select that central point.

01:39: You'll just have one new point 
in the center of each curve.

01:43: And I'm going to go ahead and move it to the 
center, so it's right there, at an Input of 128.

01:48: And based on my experience, 
I want the Output value to be 130.

01:52: So I'll press the Down Arrow 
key in my case to make it so.

01:55: And then I'll switch from Green to 
Blue and press the Escape key again.

02:00: And my central point is still 
selected, so that's great.

02:02: I'll just go ahead and nudge it over by pressing the 
Right Arrow Key a few times to an Input of 128.

02:08: And then I'll nudge it down 
to an Output value of 125.

02:12: And finally, I'll switch over to the Red Channel,
press the Escape key, nudge the Input value

02:18: over to 128, and nudge the 
Output value down to 124.

02:22: And the reason I'm making both the green and 
blue curves darker is because, bear in mind,

02:27: our snow used to be very purplish, which is a 
combination of red and blue working together,

02:32: and therefore we need to darken the Red and 
Blue channels and brighten ever so slightly

02:37: the Green Channel.

02:38: All right, that takes care 
of our Curves adjustments.

02:41: Now, if you zoom in you're going to see some 
mottling in that snow, a lot of color noise,

02:46: for example, but that's mostly because we're 
exaggerating the saturation like crazy with

02:51: that superblaster layer.

02:53: So now, go ahead and drag the darken snow 
layer back to the top of the stack and much

02:58: of that color noise will go away, not quite all, 
we'll take care of that problem in a moment.

03:03: But we've got a bigger problem right now in 
the form of this hideous posterization that's

03:09: surrounding the edge of the mask.

03:11: So you can see these areas of gray right here, 
if I Alt+Click or Opt+Click on the layer

03:16: Mask thumbnail here inside the Layers panel, 
they represent these choppy transitions between

03:21: the black pixels in the 
mask and the white pixels.

03:24: So what we need to do to solve this problem 
is blur the mask, and the best way to do that

03:29: is to Alt+Click or Opt+Click on the layer Mask, 
so that we can see the full color composite image.

03:34: Then double-click on the thumbnail to bring 
up the Properties panel, and I'm going to

03:37: reduce the size of this panel 
so I can see what I'm doing.

03:40: The solution is this guy right here, the Feather 
value, which allows you to blur the mask dynamically.

03:46: And if you click inside that value and press 
Shift+Up Arrow a few times, you'll see those

03:50: ratty posterized edges 
disappear before your very eyes.

03:54: And at a value of about 5 pixels 
everything looks to be in good shape.

03:58: Now, this is another one of those parametric 
settings, so you can come back and modify

04:02: the blurriness of this mask anytime you like.

04:05: All right, now I'll go ahead and hide the 
Properties panel, and I'll zoom out once again

04:10: to take in the entire image.

04:11: Now, we have one additional problem, which is 
we still have some very obvious color noise

04:18: going on inside of the sky 
and snow of this image.

04:22: And we can solve that problem by masking away 
the effects of the superblaster adjustment,

04:27: specifically in the sky and snow,
and here's how we'll do that.

04:30: Go ahead and Alt+drag or Opt+drag the layer 
Mask thumbnail from darken snow to superblaster

04:36: in order to duplicate that layer Mask.

04:38: Now, that's giving us exactly the opposite 
effect of what we're looking for, that is

04:42: to say, we're removing the saturation from 
the dark areas, that is the barn; and we're

04:47: keeping the saturation in the 
bright areas, that is the sky and snow.

04:51: So with this layer Mask thumbnail 
selected, go ahead and click on it.

04:56: Then press Ctrl+I or Cmd+I on the mask to 
Invert that mask, and you'll take the saturation

05:02: out of the sky and you'll leave the 
saturation in the barn, just as you see here.

05:06: All right, now I'm going to zoom out slightly 
here by reducing my Zoom value in the lower

05:11: left corner of the image window.

05:13: And this is the final effect, folks, and what's 
interesting about it is how much detail we have.

05:18: Notice that we have all this contouring 
in the snow, which is absolutely great.

05:22: We have all this detail in 
the weeds and the barn.

05:25: We can even see the distinction between the 
snow on the ground and the grayness of the

05:29: sky, none of which was 
visible in the original image.

05:32: If I Alt+Click or Opt+Click on the 
eyeball in front of the background item here,

05:36: you can see that there's barely any distinction 
between snow and sky at all; the barn is so

05:40: dark it looks like it was set on fire; and 
the ground looks as if we're snow blind.

05:46: Compare that of course to our final corrected 
version of the image, in which all sorts of

05:50: details are fully evident, including this 
strange effect right there, where the sun

05:56: is darker than the sky.

05:58: And that's how you apply the full power of 
curves to correcting even the most challenging

06:03: of photographic images.


 ** The new automatic Curves function

00:00: Now I would be a remiss if I failed to mention 
that just like Brightness/Contrast, and Levels,

00:05: Curves offers its own unique auto 
function, and it's new to CS6.

00:10: So we might as well see how it compares to 
the other two and how it might serve as a

00:14: jumping off point for a custom correction.

00:17: So I have opened this image that we first 
saw in Chapter 12 of the Intermediate course

00:22: and I'm going to duplicate it a couple of 
times by going up to the Image menu and choosing

00:25: the Duplicate command and then I will call 
this image Auto Levels and press the Enter

00:29: key or the Return key on the Mac, Zoom on in,
then create another Duplicate by going

00:34: back to that same command and this time I'll 
call my image Auto Curves and press Enter

00:39: or Return on the Mac and zoom in as well.

00:41: All right, let's start off with the first image 
here and I will drop down to the black/white

00:45: icon and choose Brightness/Contrast and I'll 
go ahead and click on Auto, it's going to

00:50: take a moment to calculate, and then you'll 
see the correction in the background, and

00:54: quite honestly for this particular exercise, 
we don't need a big huge properties panel.

01:00: So that's the Brightness/Contrast correction.

01:01: I am going to switch over to the Auto Levels 
image, drop down to the black/white icon and

01:07: choose Levels and then I will click on its 
Auto button and we end up with this variation.

01:13: And then I'll switch over to the final Image 
drop down to the black/white icon and choose

01:17: Curves and I will click on its Auto 
button, and we end up with this.

01:22: So for the sake of comparison here, this is 
the automatic Brightness/Contrast variation.

01:28: This is the Automatic Levels variation, not 
nearly so garish, probably the most successful

01:32: of the bunch where this particular image is 
concerned, and this is the Auto Curves variation.

01:39: Now naturally, everything we are seeing is 
specific to this particular photograph, your

01:43: results may vary dramatically, but the real 
point is you may luck out and Photoshop may

01:48: do a great job or what Photoshop comes up 
with may be a great jumping off point.

01:53: Now when I corrected this image back in Chapter 
12 using Levels, I had to apply two applications

01:58: of a Levels Adjustment layer.

02:00: One, across the entire image and another 
just to brighten up the shadow regions and the

02:05: awnings on these wooden shutters here, whereas, 
I can correct this whole image using one pass

02:11: of curves, as I'm about to show you.

02:13: So I will go ahead and double-click on the 
thumbnail for this Curves 1 layer, and I will

02:17: also increase the size of my Properties panel, 
so that I can take in the entire curves graph.

02:21: I am going to start things out by dragging 
this white slider triangle, until I get to

02:26: an input value of 194.

02:29: So I am mapping everything, that's 194 or 
brighter to 255 which of course is white.

02:33: Then I will press the minus key in order 
to select that bright point right there.

02:38: Notice that it has an Input of 173, I am 
going to press the left arrow key a few times to

02:42: back it off to 170, and then I will press Shift+
Down arrow to take the Output value down to 220.

02:48: All right, so that takes down some of the 
heat inside of those highlights, but now

02:53: I need to brighten the shadows, and I will do 
so by switching over to the Target Adjustment

02:56: tool and I'm going to search for a very dark 
color like right about there, you can see

03:01: that my cursor is very close to the top of 
the image, above the wooden shutters and

03:06: I found an Input of 14 at this location and 
I'm going to drag up in until I get to an

03:12: Output of 28, should do the trick.

03:16: And then I'll move my cursor back into the 
Properties panel, so I can see those values

03:20: and I'll press the left arrow key in 
order to nudge that Input value to 15.

03:24: So Input should be 15, Output should be 28.

03:27: Then I wanted to open up the shadows a bit, 
by taking this point right there, the point

03:32: that Photoshop created automatically and I'm 
going to just kind of drag it up to graph to

03:37: about this location, actually I want the 
Input value to be 96, so I will go and press the

03:42: Right Arrow key a few times and an Output 
value of 115 is exactly what I'm looking for.

03:48: And that takes care of it, so I will go 
ahead and close the Properties panel, so we can

03:51: see what we have done here.

03:52: I will turned the Curves layer off, this is 
the before, dark low contrast version of the

03:56: image, this is the after version 
of the image with more contrast.

04:00: Now the thing about those kinds of radical curves 
adjustments, I will go and bring it back up here.

04:06: Where you're brightening the shadows and then 
you're dimming the midtones and then you are

04:09: brightening the highlights again, so you are 
going back and forth, is that they have a

04:13: habit of reducing the Saturation of the colors,
so we can end up with some drab images or

04:19: patches of gray, you need to watch that.

04:21: But one way to solve the 
problem is to add a Vibrance layer.

04:24: So I'll drop down to the black/white icon, 
click on it, choose Vibrance and I'm going

04:29: to take that Vibrance value way up to 70, 
so I'm pressing Shift+Up arrow seven times

04:34: in a row and we end up with this effect here.

04:37: Now that looks great where the shutters are 
concerned and where the awning is concerned

04:42: as well, but the colors are a little bit 
too hot in the bright sections of the wall.

04:46: So we need to mask this Vibrance Adjustment 
using the opposite of Luminance Mask,

04:51: which is a Density Mask.

04:53: Let me show you how that works.

04:54: I'll Alt+Click or Opt+Click on 
the eye in front of background.

04:58: Then I will go to the Channels panel, and 
you can see here that the Red Channel is the

05:02: brightest, the Green channel starts darkening 
up and the Blue channel does the best job

05:06: of showing us those shadow regions, 
regions that need more vibrancy.

05:10: It shows them up the darkest and we have 
the most contrast across the entire image.

05:15: So I will go ahead and Ctrl+Click or Cmd+
Click on the Blue Channel in order to load it as

05:19: a selection, so we are selecting the highlights,
deselecting the shadows, switch back to the

05:24: RGB image, switch over to Layers panel, turn those 
layers back on by Alt+Clicking or Opt+Clicking

05:31: on the eye in front of the background.

05:32: My Vibrance layer is selected and this time 
instead of clicking on the Add Layer Mask

05:37: icon, I will press the Alt key or the 
Option key on the Mac and click on it.

05:42: And that will go ahead and give us 
a layer mask that looks like this.

05:45: Just go ahead and Alt+Click or Opt+Click 
on the layer Mask Thumbnail and you can see

05:49: that we have an inverted version of that Blue 
Channel and that is what is meant by a Density Mask.

05:55: That is we are masking the 
image based on ink density.

05:57: All right, now I am going to increase the 
contrast of this mask by pressing Ctrl+L or Cmd+L

06:02: on the Mac in order to bring up the Levels dialog 
box and I'll take this black slider up to about 60.

06:08: The point in which the Histogram begins, and 
then I'll click on the white point value and

06:13: press Shift+Down arrow a few times, until 
we really dramatically open up that shadow

06:17: detail, that is to say the highlights that 
we are using to select the shadows, and then

06:22: happens at about 195.

06:24: So 60 for the black point value, 195 for the 
white point value, that's it, click OK and

06:29: then Alt+Click or Opt+Click on the layer 
Mask Thumbnail again, in order to achieve

06:34: the effect you see before you.

06:36: All right, and just to see what we've been able 
to achieve, I will Alt+Click or Opt+Click

06:40: on the eye in front of the background, that's 
the original version of the image, and this

06:45: is the corrected version of the image based 
in small part on the Auto button, that is

06:50: included along with Curves and in larger part 
on your ability to edit those Curve Settings,

06:54: anyway you like.


 ** Camera Raw

00:00: Photoshop ships with a file browser called 
Bridge, because it serves as a kind of bridge

00:05: between your images and Photoshop.

00:07: Photoshop and Bridge are independent programs 
and they both offer a very powerful plug-in

00:13: called Camera Raw, which is 
the topic of this chapter.

00:17: The primary purpose of Camera Raw is to process 
photographs captured with a mid range or professional

00:22: level digital camera and saved in 
your camera's RAW file format.

00:27: This format varies from one 
camera vendor to the next.

00:30: Canon calls its format CR2. Nikon uses NEF.

00:34: Fuji uses whatever Fuji uses and so on.

00:38: Whatever the format, this RAW file represents the 
unprocessed data captured by the camera's image sensor.

00:44: Such a file is typically several times larger 
than an equivalent JPEG, but it also contains

00:50: way more information, including a 
wider range of luminance data.

00:55: Think of it this way, if Photoshop lets you 
edit a photograph and integrate it into a

00:59: larger piece of artwork; Camera Raw lets you 
develop the photo, meaning that it really

01:05: is a digital darkroom.

01:07: You start by adjusting the white balance, 
which is the basic color cast of the image.

01:11: Then you expose the photo, correct 
the contrast and enhance the colors.

01:16: You can even modify certain areas 
of a photo independently of others.

01:21: The amazing thing is that every modification 
is nondestructive, as with Smart Objects,

01:26: you can not harm an image in Camera Raw, plus 
you can correct multiple images at a time,

01:32: something Photoshop can't do, and you can 
copy modifications from one image to another.

01:38: Camera Raw works inside Photoshop, it works 
inside Bridge, and it's fully compatible with

01:43: Adobe's other photo development program, Lightroom.
Plus, it lets you edit regular, old, everyday

01:49: JPEG and TIFF images.

01:52: If you are a photographer, 
Camera Raw is your development tool.

01:55: If you are an artist or designer, Camera Raw lets 
you precisely manipulate the work of others.

02:01: If Camera Raw costs an extra 300 bucks, I 
would tell you to buy it, but as long as you

02:05: have Photoshop, it doesn't cost 
anything, and here's how it works.


 ** Opening and editing multiple images

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to both open 
and modify multiple images at a time in Camera Raw,

00:05: which is something you 
can't do inside Photoshop.

00:08: So in Photoshop, it's just one image or 
composition at a time, whereas in Camera Raw,

00:13: you can modify as many images as you like.

00:15: I'm currently working in Bridge, and you can 
get to Bridge by choosing Browse in Bridge

00:19: from the File menu inside Photoshop.

00:22: And I've got Bridge trained on the 27_camera_raw 
folder inside the exercise files folder,

00:28: and I'm looking at four images here; 
Swim meet-1 through 4.

00:32: They're all DNG files which stands for Digital 
Negative, which is Adobe's open standard

00:38: for RAW digital photographs.

00:40: But you might be working with CR2s or NEFs 
or ORFs, there's all kinds of file formats

00:46: out there depending on your camera vendor.

00:48: Now, you may see more images than this inside this 
folder, I am populating the folder as I go along.

00:54: I'm going to click on Swim meet-1, Shift+Click 
on Swim meet-4 to select all four files,

00:59: and there's a couple of different ways 
to open RAW images in Camera Raw.

01:03: One way is to go to the File menu and choose 
the Open command or press Ctrl+O or Cmd+O on a Mac,

01:08: and that's going to open Camera Raw 
as a plugin inside Photoshop, which means

01:13: you'll be occupying Photoshop's 
attention and freeing up Bridge.

01:17: If you'd rather go the other way around, if 
you'd rather run Camera Raw as a plugin inside

01:22: Bridge, and leave Photoshop free, then you 
go down here to this command, Open in Camera Raw

01:28: or you'd press Ctrl+R 
or Cmd+R on the Mac.

01:31: And that's the way that we'll be working, 
because that will allow us to see our modifications

01:36: in Bridge when we're done.

01:37: So I will go ahead and choose the 
command and that brings up Camera Raw.

01:41: And if this is a first time you've entered 
Camera Raw, then you'll see the plugin inside

01:44: of the dialog box.

01:45: If you'd rather consume the entire window, 
which you might as well, because you can't

01:50: switch back to Bridge by clicking on it here, 
then click on this icon, or press the F key

01:55: to fill the entire screen.

01:57: Now, notice that we're seeing the open images 
in a vertical filmstrip, and we're seeing

02:01: the selected image of my youngest son with a 
scratch on his face here inside the Image Preview.

02:07: And currently, just one image is selected as 
you can see, so if I make any modifications,

02:12: I will affect that image, 
and none of the others.

02:14: If you want to edit all the images at the 
same time, then either click on the Select

02:18: All button or press Ctrl+A or Cmd+A on the Mac, 
and that will go ahead and select all of them.

02:24: Now, if you want to switch from one image to 
another, that is, you want to see a different

02:28: image inside the preview, then press the 
Down Arrow key to advance to the next image

02:34: or you can press the Up Arrow key 
to advance to a previous image.

02:38: Another way to work, if you want to skip down 
to an image for example, is not to click on it,

02:42: because if you click on that thumbnail 
there in the filmstrip, you will not only

02:46: switch to it, but you also 
deselect all the other images.

02:49: So I will press Ctrl+A or Cmd+A on a Mac 
in order to select them all once again.

02:54: Instead what you do is you Alt+Click or you 
Opt+Click on the thumbnail, and that not

02:59: only switches to that image, but it keeps 
all the other images selected as well.

03:03: Now, notice all these correction options that 
are available to us in the Basic panel,

03:08: and we'll be running through exactly how 
these options work in future movies.

03:11: But for now, what I'd like you to do is just 
click on this Auto button; so yet another

03:16: automatic means of correcting the 
color of images inside Photoshop.

03:20: And this one often works very well.

03:22: I will go ahead and click on Auto, and we 
can see that just like that, we've changed

03:26: the luminance of all of the selected images.

03:29: And notice the Auto button just affects these 
6 options right here; so Exposure, all the

03:34: way down to Blacks.

03:36: Now, we're not seeing any numerical values 
anymore, because each and every one of the

03:41: images has been modified differently, 
and to varying degrees of success.

03:45: So, if I go ahead and just click on one of 
the thumbnails to select it independently

03:49: of the others, then you can see the numerical 
values that Camera Raw has automatically applied.

03:55: And in the case of this image, Camera Raw 
has done a pretty good job, you can check

03:59: out the uncorrected version of the image by 
turning off the Preview checkbox and you can

04:04: also toggle that checkbox 
by pressing the P key.

04:07: So this is before, and this is after.

04:10: I will go ahead and switch down to this next 
one, this one looks pretty good as well, this

04:13: is before and this is after.

04:16: And finally, we've got this guy here again, looks 
pretty darn good, this is before, and this is after.

04:23: Now let's say you decide that you want to 
apply the modifications assigned to one of

04:28: the images to all the images, because for 
example, this very first one, Swim meet-1

04:33: didn't come out too well, it's way too bright.

04:37: So what I'd like to do is go ahead and 
select all the images again, I will press Ctrl+A

04:41: or Cmd+A on the Mac, and then you 
want to switch to the image that you like.

04:45: So I will Alt+Click or Opt+Click on Swim 
meet-4 for example, and then you've got this

04:50: Synchronize button, that will assign the settings 
that you've applied to this image, to all of them.

04:56: And there are two ways to use Synchronize; 
one is just to click on the button, and you'll

05:00: get this massive dialog box of 
options that are available to you.

05:05: So basically, you're synchronizing every single 
development setting and the only things you're

05:09: not synchronizing are things like Crop and 
Spot Removal and Local Adjustments, which

05:14: would just work for one 
image at a time anyway.

05:17: So, you could go ahead and click OK at this 
point, but what I like to do is just skip

05:21: this dialog box, because it seems to me that it's set 
up exactly the way I'd want it to be by default.

05:27: So I will click Cancel, and if you want to 
skip, you press the Alt key or the Option

05:32: key on the Mac, that gets rid of the little 
dot, dot, dot, after synchronize, then you

05:36: just go ahead, and click on the button 
and everything happens automatically.

05:40: And now, if I click on the thumbnail for 
Swim meet-1, we see a much better development.

05:45: And by the way, keep an eye on the 
upper-right corner of the Preview here.

05:51: If you switch to a different image and you 
see a yellow caution sign for a moment, that

05:55: doesn't mean anything is wrong, that just 
means that Camera Raw is trying to keep up

05:59: with you, so it needs to refresh 
the preview on screen. All right.

06:02: Now that we're done, a couple of different 
ways to work; one is to press Ctrl+A, again,

06:08: Cmd+A on the Mac, and then you can click 
on this Open Images button, and that's going

06:12: to open all four images inside Photoshop.

06:15: If you just have one thumbnail selected, then 
it changes to the Open Image button, and you'll

06:20: open just that one image.

06:22: And that's great if you want to apply more 
modifications inside Photoshop, but it's not

06:27: necessary if you just want to save 
these images to a different file format.

06:30: In that case, if you want to save all these 
images as JPEGs or TIFFs for example, you'd

06:34: press Ctrl+A, once again, Cmd+A on the Mac, 
to select them all, and then you click

06:39: on the Save Images button, and then you can go 
ahead and decide which file formats you want to use.

06:45: For example, you can select 
JPEG, TIFF what have you.

06:49: However, what I am going to do is cancel out 
of this dialog box, and just click on Done,

06:54: because that goes ahead and applies our changes 
to the images without opening them in Photoshop,

07:00: and then you see, when we return to Bridge, 
that all of the thumbnails update to reflect

07:04: our modification and we have these little icons 
in the upper-right corners of the thumbnails

07:09: that show us that the images 
include development settings.

07:13: However, and it's worth noting, that these 
modifications have been saved as metadata.

07:18: In other words, not a single pixel has 
been permanently modified inside the image.

07:23: And because I'm working with DNG files which 
is the Adobe standard, the metadata is saved

07:28: directly to the file, and I can see that 
metadata by moving down here to the Metadata panel,

07:33: which by default lives in the 
lower-right corner of the screen.

07:36: And if I go ahead and twirl close File Properties,
you can see there's this item called Camera Raw,

07:41: you may have to scroll down to it, and 
I will go ahead and twirl it open, and then

07:45: I can see my Exposure, Highlight, Shadows, 
Whites, Blacks, and Contrast settings,

07:50: all of which were modified automatically 
when I clicked on that Auto button.

07:55: And that's how you open and modify 
multiple images at a time in Camera Raw.


 ** Correcting white balance

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to adjust 
white balance using the Temperature and Tint

00:03: controls and this is another one of those 
things that Camera Raw does better than Photoshop.

00:09: Now I first introduced you to these controls 
back in Chapter 8 of the Fundamentals course,

00:14: but rest assured we're going to 
take a deeper dive this time.

00:17: So once again I have Swim meet-1 through 4 
selected in Bridge, and I'll press Ctrl+R

00:23: or Cmd+R on a Mac, in order to bring up 
Camera Raw, and then I'll press Ctrl+A or

00:27: Cmd+A on the Mac, in order to select all 
of the thumbnails, and then you'll see the

00:32: White Balance controls at 
the top of the Basic panel.

00:35: Now the whole purpose of white balance is 
to neutralize the light source, so as long

00:40: as the light source comes off as being white, 
then the colors in your scene will look accurate.

00:45: So you can start things off if you 
like by selecting a light source.

00:49: For example, if you select Cloudy, you're going to 
go ahead and warm up the scene as you see here.

00:55: If you choose something like Tungsten, 
then you're going to cool the scene down.

00:59: Now that may seem like the opposite of the 
way it should work, after all tungsten is

01:04: a very warm light source, and as all of 
us know, cloudy days produce cool images.

01:10: What Camera Raw is trying to do is compensate 
for that light source, so in order to make

01:15: the colors look right on a cloudy day,
they need to be made more warm.

01:19: Whereas to make a scene look right when it was 
shot using tungsten lighting, you need to

01:23: cool the scene down.

01:25: You can also manually adjust the Temperature 
setting, so notice if I drag this slider triangle

01:31: over to the right, I'm going to warm up the scene.

01:34: If I drag it over to the left, I'm going to 
cool the scene down, and I might go ahead

01:38: and set this to something 
pretty darn warm such as 4900.

01:43: Now that's 4900 degrees Kelvin by the way, 
which is actually a very cool light source.

01:49: Again, Camera Raw is 
compensating for that light source.

01:52: Next, drop down to the Tint slider and as I 
explained back in Chapter 8, this is a perpendicular

01:58: access of color, so Temperature runs across 
the big color wheel at one angle and Tint

02:04: run through the wheel at a perpendicular angle.

02:06: So, at this point I'm thinking that there is 
a little bit too much pink inside the scene,

02:12: so I'm going to compensate 
by dragging away from pink.

02:15: We never want to add green or pink to a scene.

02:19: You really just want to get rid of a preponderance 
of that color, so I'll go and take this value

02:25: down to something like -14.

02:29: Another way to work and you may prefer this 
way over fiddling with the controls is to

02:33: take advantage of this White Balance tool, 
which often times produces impeccable results.

02:40: Go ahead and select the tool and then the 
idea is you want to click on a light gray,

02:45: and the reason you want to go with the light 
gray is because there will be a little bit

02:48: of a color cast inside of it, you don't want 
to go with a dark gray, because shadows tend

02:52: to contain a lot of noise.

02:54: So in the case of this image you might click inside the 
eye for example, in order to neutralize the scene.

03:01: You could try to click on the tooth, but the 
thing is teeth contain a certain amount of

03:05: yellow, and so Camera Raw is probably going 
to end up over compensating as we see here,

03:10: or because my youngest son Sam here is 
wearing a cap that includes a stripe of white, you

03:15: could just go ahead and click on that white 
in order to neutralize the scene as well and

03:19: that ends up coming off quite nicely.

03:21: All right, now I'm just going to nudge this 
value up by pressing the Up Arrow key and

03:26: you can see each time you press Up Arrow, 
when Temperature is selected, you increase

03:30: that value in increments of 50 degrees or 
you can press Shift+Up Arrow in order to move

03:36: in increments of 500 degrees.

03:38: Anyway, I'm going to take that back down to 
something like 4550 should work, and then

03:43: I might drop down to the Tint value and adjust it 
as well, maybe take it up a couple of increments,

03:48: totally up to you, White Balance is 
ultimately a subjective modification.

03:53: And then when you're done, go ahead and click 
on the Done button in order to return to Bridge

03:58: and update your thumbnails.

04:00: And that's how you quickly and easily correct 
the White Balance of your images using the

04:08: Temperature in Tint 
controls inside Camera Raw.


 ** The revamped Exposure controls

00:00: In this movie, I will show you how to work 
with the Exposure options, which have been

00:04: completely revamped in Camera Raw 7.

00:07: So I am going to select both View from Alcatraz-1 
and -2, and press Ctrl+R

00:11: or Cmd+R on the Mac to 
open these images in Camera Raw.

00:14: Then I will press Ctrl+A or Cmd+A on the 
Mac to select both of them and I will press

00:18: the Down Arrow key in order to 
advance to the second image.

00:22: Now both of the images are quite washed out 
and your primary means of correcting luminance

00:28: inside of Camera Raw are these six 
sliders Exposure through Blacks.

00:33: Now you could just go ahead and click on the Auto 
button if you want to and that will dramatically

00:37: enhance the scene, they are not exactly 
the enhancements I want to apply however.

00:42: And for purposes of demonstration, 
I want to start from scratch.

00:45: So I am going to click on Default in order 
to reset all six of these values to zero.

00:50: And we are going to start down here at the bottom 
because things are so different than they used to be.

00:55: Now you might think of Whites as being 
analogous to the White slider triangle that you find

00:59: inside Levels and Curves, except the big difference 
is in addition to raising the Whites value

01:05: which is going to brighten the whites 
and potentially clip them as well.

01:09: And we can see that we have clipped some 
colors by the way in the Red channel because

01:15: this little highlight clipping 
warning is appearing red.

01:18: So if it appears red you are clipping red, 
if it ends up appearing white as it is now

01:23: then we are clipping in all three 
channels and obviously that's a bad thing.

01:27: If you want to see where that clipping is 
occurring then you press the Alt key or the

01:30: Opt key on the Mac just as you do in Levels 
and Curves as you drag this White slider triangle.

01:36: And that will show you which colors are 
clipping there inside the Image Preview.

01:41: But in addition to brightening and potentially 
clipping highlights you can also darken your Whites,

01:47: and thereby retrieve otherwise clipped highlights.

01:51: So highlights that were clipped when we first 
entered Camera Raw are now coming back from the dead.

01:56: All right, in my case I am going to Alt+Drag 
or Opt+Drag this White slider triangle

02:00: until I see a little bit of clipping 
occurring there inside the preview and that

02:05: happens at about a value of +25.

02:08: So it's looking like I am making the scene 
brighter than ever and more washed out as well,

02:11: we will take care of that in just a moment.

02:14: Next we have Blacks, now if you reduce the 
Blacks value, it's just like raising the black

02:20: point value inside Levels, that is to say 
you can clip your shadows if you like.

02:25: And in my case I am seeing cyan for the shadow 
clipping warning which tells me I am clipping

02:30: in both the Green and Blue channels.

02:33: And if I take it so low that I see white that 
tells me that I am clipping in all three channels.

02:38: If you want to see where the clipping is 
occurring you press the Alt key or the Opt key on

02:42: the Mac as you drag the slider triangle.

02:46: But I want to go ahead and take it down, I still 
have Alt or Option down as well by the way.

02:50: I want to take this value down to a point 
where only that sweatshirt, that red sweatshirt

02:55: is clipping and it's just 
clipping in the Green channel.

02:58: And I know that, by the way, because if I back 
off to the point that we are just seeing a

03:02: little bit of clipping inside the sweatshirt, 
I'm seeing a green warning at the top of the

03:07: screen, and of course, Magenta tells me that 
I'm clipping green as well because its green's

03:11: color complement.

03:12: All right, so I am going to 
take that value down to -30.

03:16: Next what we have is this Exposure control.

03:19: Now Exposure in previous versions of Camera Raw 
was analogous to a white point control,

03:25: it was more sophisticated.

03:27: But now it's more analogous to a Gamma 
control, again a more sophisticated one.

03:32: And you can see if you increase the Exposure 
value -- take a look at that Histogram in

03:36: the upper right corner -- we are 
shoving the entire histogram around.

03:41: So if I raise Exposure I am brightening the 
entire scene across the spectrum, if I reduce

03:46: the Exposure value I am darkening 
the entire scene across the spectrum.

03:50: Now one of the big differences between Gamma 
and Exposure is that Gamma never clips, where

03:55: Exposure will clip.

03:57: You can see right now that I've managed to 
clip shadows in all three channels in fact.

04:02: And you can see where that clipping is 
occurring by pressing the Alt key or the Opt key

04:06: on the Mac while 
dragging this slider triangle.

04:08: And I am going to tell you that Alt+Drag or 
Opt+Drag trick works with all six of these

04:14: sliders except for Contrast, so it 
works with Highlights and Shadows as well.

04:18: Anyway, I am going to take this value down 
pretty low actually because I want to deepen

04:23: the colors in the scene.

04:24: So I will take it down to -0.7.

04:27: All right, next I'll also knock 
down the Contrast just a little bit.

04:31: So I am just going to take it to -10 just 
to take a little bit of the contrast out of

04:35: the scene because there's an awful lot of 
contrast here in the first place, very bright day.

04:40: And now let's take a look at Highlights and 
Shadows, and these guys are pretty amazing.

04:44: I want you to watch the Histogram again, and 
you are going to see just the right half of

04:49: the histogram change when I brighten 
the highlights or darken the highlights.

04:55: So I'm really limiting my adjustments to just 
the lightest colors inside the image, essentially

05:00: the lightest half of the Luminance levels.

05:03: And there's a little bit of fade over into 
the darkest half as well, but you have an

05:07: amazing amount of control.

05:09: And I am going to take those Highlights down 
pretty low, and by the way you can Alt+Drag

05:13: or Opt+Drag this slider 
triangle to preview any clipping.

05:17: I am going to take it down to -80.

05:19: And now watch Shadows, it does pretty much 
the flip thing over here in the Shadow region,

05:25: where this image is concerned it's going to 
affect this big blue lump as well as this

05:29: red lump in the middle.

05:31: So if I brighten the Shadows I am going to 
squish that red lump over like so and if

05:36: I darken the Shadows I am going to 
turn that blue thing into a big spike.

05:40: But there's very little action if any 
happening over here in the Highlight region.

05:44: Now in our case what we want to do is brighten 
the shadows inside Sammy's face for example,

05:49: as well as the Shadows on the side of Max's.

05:52: So I will go ahead and take this 
Shadows value up to something like +70.

05:56: Again, if you want a preview clipping, you press the 
Alt key or the Option key on the Mac as you drag.

06:02: Now the reason I am not concerned about the 
clipping inside this sweatshirt is because

06:07: obviously we have a lot of 
depth associated with it.

06:10: It's just clipping green and that's just a function 
of this sweatshirt being so very darn saturated.

06:16: All right.

06:17: So these are the settings I came up with, 
and then I decided that I wanted to raise

06:20: the Vibrance, but taking the Vibrance up as 
far as I want to go for the sake of the scene

06:26: just to keep it nice and colorful, ends up 
making the sweatshirt look pretty ridiculous.

06:31: So tell you what we are going to do.

06:32: It doesn't need to be that supersaturated.

06:35: I'm going to switch to the Targeted Adjustment 
tool, and then this is a kind of preview of

06:39: upcoming attractions here, and I am going to 
click and hold on it and choose Saturation.

06:44: And then I will drag down on the sweatshirt 
in order to take some of that saturation out

06:49: of it, and we end up with something that isn't 
quite shouting for attention like it was before,

06:54: even though these are perhaps the baggiest 
T-shirts on the face of the planet, but the

06:59: kids love them so.

07:00: I'll switch back to Basic here and now I can 
go ahead and take Vibrance up some more to

07:05: let's say about +50 is what I'm searching for.

07:08: And we end up with these versions of the scene.

07:11: And just so we can sort of see things up 
close and personal here I am going to zoom in by

07:16: pressing Ctrl++ or Cmd++ a few times.

07:19: And let's preview what we've 
managed to accomplish here.

07:21: I will press the P key in order to see the 
original version of this image, you can see

07:25: that it's just so blown out by comparison, 
and then I will press P again in order to

07:30: bring back my modifications.

07:31: All right, and just to make sure that we are 
happy with the other image, I will press the

07:35: Up Arrow key in order to switch to it and 
press Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0 on the Mac to fit

07:40: the image inside the preview and I will press 
the P key in order to see the original version

07:45: of the image, quite washed out as you can see,
and I will press the P key again to see

07:49: the much better modification, thanks to 
my Exposure adjustments. All right.

07:54: Now I'll go ahead and click the Done button 
in order to add the metadata to the images

07:58: and update the image thumbnails inside Bridge.

08:07: And that's how you work with the new 
Exposure Controls inside Camera Raw 7.


 ** Working with archival images

00:00: In this movie I will show you how to work 
with archival images, that is photographs

00:04: that you've modified using 
Camera Raw 6 or earlier.

00:07: And I have two such images here, 
Lighthouse-1 and Lighthouse-2.

00:10: I will select them both in Bridge and press 
Ctrl+R or Cmd+R on a Mac in order to open

00:16: them in Camera Raw.

00:17: Now I want to preserve my previous modifications 
just in case I want to come back to them.

00:21: And you can do that by creating snapshots.

00:24: So I will press Ctrl+A or Cmd+A 
on the Mac to select both images.

00:28: And then I will switch to the final panel 
here by clicking on the snapshots icon.

00:33: And I will dropdown to the little Page icon 
and click on it, and I'll call these settings

00:36: ACR6 edits because after all I modified the 
images in Adobe Camera Raw 6 which shipped

00:42: along with Photoshop CS5.

00:44: And then I will click OK 
in order to that snapshot.

00:48: Now notice even though the snapshot appears 
here inside the Snapshots panel where this

00:53: image is concerned, if I press the Down Arrow key in 
order to switch to the next image I see no snapshot.

00:59: And that's because snapshots is that one thing 
that you can only do to one image at a time

01:04: even if multiple images are selected.

01:07: So once again dropdown to the Page icon, 
click on it, enter ACR6 edits and then click OK.

01:14: All right, now let's go ahead and 
switch back to the Basic panel.

01:18: And these images are so different, I'm 
going to have to modify them independently.

01:20: I only selected both of them so 
you could see that snapshots thing.

01:24: So I will just go ahead and click 
on Lighthouse-1 and select it.

01:27: And notice this little Exclamation Point 
(!) in the lower right corner of the screen.

01:32: That shows me that this image has been  
modified in the previous version of Camera Raw

01:36: and therefore I'm seeing 
completely different sliders.

01:39: The old ones in fact, Exposure, Recovery, 
Fill Light, Blacks, Brightness, and Contrast.

01:45: In order to switch things up for the Camera Raw 6 
controls you need to click on that Exclamation Point,

01:49: and then we will see Exposure, 
Contrast, Highlights and so forth.

01:54: Now what Camera Raw is trying to do is the best 
job possible of matching the previous effect.

02:00: So it's gone ahead and automatically 
dialed in a few values here.

02:04: But I want to start over again, so I will go 
ahead and click on default so you can see

02:07: just how bad this image 
was in the first place.

02:10: And the first thing I am going to do is adjust 
the Exposure, Whites, and Blacks controls.

02:15: So I will take that Exposure value up to say 0.5 
which gives the image a little extra brightness.

02:21: And you'll find that sort of modest 
exposure adjustments tend to work best.

02:26: And now I figure the Blacks 
value is fine the way it is.

02:30: If I Alt+Drag or Opt+Drag on the slider 
triangle you can see that we already have

02:33: some clipping at work here, so 
best just to leave it alone.

02:36: However, I have plenty of room 
were the Whites are concerned.

02:40: So I will go ahead and Alt+Drag or Opt+Drag 
on the White slider triangle until I start

02:45: to see some clipping which happens at about 
+60, you can see a little bit of clipping

02:50: in the top right portion of the image.

02:52: Now I figure we have a little bit too much 
contrast where this image is concerned,

02:56: so I will just take the contrast value down to 
-50 and then I could breathe some life into

03:01: the shadows because after all we've got some pretty 
dark shadows underneath the top of this tower.

03:08: And I do so of course by dragging up on the 
Shadows value, but that ends up washing out

03:13: the rest of the image so I am 
going to leave that thing set to 0.

03:17: Instead, I will go ahead and press Ctrl+0 
or Cmd+0 on the Mac to zoom out.

03:21: I am going to take that Highlights 
value all the way down to -100.

03:25: And that ends up muting those highlights 
so that they are not nearly so garish.

03:28: All right I think the scene 
needs a little additional color.

03:31: So I am going to go down to the Saturation 
value, maybe bump it up to let's say 20.

03:36: And then I'll Shift+Tab back to the 
Vibrance value and take it up to 30.

03:39: So we end up with this very cheerful scene, 
especially given that it used to look like this,

03:44: that is to say the image I get when I 
click on the Default button, if I want to

03:48: get back my changes, which I desperately do, 
then I can just press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z

03:52: on the Mac, you have one 
level of undo inside Camera Raw.

03:57: Now if I want to compare this to my ACR6 
settings then I'd just go ahead and switch over to

04:01: snapshots, take a moment to 
go ahead save a new snapshot.

04:05: By clicking on the Page icon I will enter ACR7 
edits this time, and then I will click OK.

04:11: So this is what I had before in 
the previous version of Photoshop.

04:15: Looks pretty good but I don't think 
as good as what I'm getting now.

04:19: Thanks to my Exposure controls 
here inside Camera Raw 7.

04:23: We will see a more dramatic difference 
if we switch over here to Lighthouse-2.

04:27: If I go back to Basic panel here and click 
on Default, you'll see that this image was

04:31: in terrible shape, this is that classic image 
that has blown highlights all over the place.

04:37: So if I press the Alt key and drag on that 
Exposure triangle, you can see that we have

04:42: white all over that sky, those are 
highlights that are really super blown out.

04:47: So with the Alt key down I will just go ahead 
and drag this slider triangle over until most

04:52: of the clipping goes away which 
happens in the Exposure of about -1.00.

04:59: And that ends up bringing back the sky quite 
nicely, so we have all kinds of detail inside

05:03: those clouds now that we 
didn't have just a moment ago.

05:06: However, it really darkens up that lighthouse.

05:10: Now I have made a mistake, by the way, I was 
going to tab down to Contrast right there,

05:14: but instead its Recovery.

05:16: And the reason is I didn't update 
to the new Camera Raw 7 controls.

05:20: So we will click on the Exclamation Point 
in the lower right corner of the image and

05:24: now I'm seeing what things look like with 
an Exposure of -1, so went ahead and kept

05:28: that value and everything else zeroed out.

05:31: All right, now I will select that 
Contrast value and take it down to -25.

05:36: And I want to really brighten up those shadows.

05:39: So I will drag this slider triangle up until I get 
the Shadows value of +80 is what I'm looking for.

05:45: And that brightens up the lighthouse 
as well as the ground quite nicely.

05:49: And then I'll take the highlights down further 
by reducing this Highlights value to -50,

05:55: and we ended bringing even 
more detail out in those clouds.

05:59: And now we don't have any clipping at all. Both 
the Shadow Clipping warning and the Highlight

06:04: Clipping warning appear black, meaning 
not even a single pixel is clipped.

06:08: But we have so little contrast at this point and we 
can fix that using the Blacks and Whites sliders.

06:14: So I'm going to start with Whites, I will 
press the Alt key or the Option key on the Mac

06:17: and drag that triangle until I start to 
see clipping which occurs right about at +30.

06:23: And then I'll Alt+Drag or Opt+Drag Blacks 
and you can take that one all the way down

06:28: to -100 and get just a little bit of 
clipping as you are seeing on screen.

06:32: But I decided to back it off to -80 like so.

06:35: And then I took that Saturation value up to 
50 and I am going to take the Vibrance value

06:40: up to 50 as well so that we have this very 
colorful ground and sky as you can see.

06:46: All right, so just to see the difference here, 
if I click on Default we'll see the original

06:50: version of the image, it's 
just horrible by comparison.

06:53: And then if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on 
the Mac we see the much better version here.

06:58: And by the way you also have this Clarity 
slider that we haven't seen before, that creates

07:03: big thick Edge Contrast.

07:06: So if you drag it all the way down, you get 
this kind of Thomas Kinkade Effect if you

07:10: will, bless his heart.

07:12: And then if you increase that value like crazy 
you end up creating a kind of haunted lighthouse.

07:17: Anyway, I am just going to 
leave that guy set to 0.

07:20: Now I will switch back over to Snapshots so we 
can compare ACR7 to ACR6 and I will dropdown

07:26: to little Page icon, click on it, enter a name 
for the snapshot like ACR7 edits, click OK.

07:32: So here's what we had at 
the outset of this movie.

07:35: Better than the original, that's for sure, 
but our new edits are that much better.

07:40: All right, now I will just go ahead and click 
done in order to accept my modifications and

07:45: update the thumbnails here inside Bridge.

07:54: And that's how you work with archival 
images as well as snapshots in Camera Raw 7.


 ** The Spot Removal and Graduated Filter tools

00:00: This time I have three images open in Camera 
Raw, we're going to start things off in

00:04: View from Alcatraz-2.dng.

00:04: Now, before we leave the Basic panel, I want 
to show you a few tools that are available

00:10: to you up here in the toolbar.

00:12: Starting with the Spot Removal tool, and ending 
with the Graduated Filter, we have a collection

00:17: of four tools that allow you to brush 
in modifications inside of Camera Raw.

00:22: So I'll start by demonstrating Spot 
Removal, it's pretty easy to use.

00:26: The idea, let's say I want to get rid of 
whatever this thing is, whether it's a piece of camera

00:31: guck or it's something falling off this tree, 
or some weird shaped bird, let's say I want

00:35: to get rid of it.

00:36: Well, what you do is instead of brushing, 
you drag a circle around it, like so, and

00:41: then you decide where your source should be.

00:44: So green is source; red is destination.

00:46: I'll go ahead and move the source over 
to this location, set the Type to Heal.

00:51: If you'd prefer to Clone instead, you can 
do that, but Healing is going to generally

00:54: blend in the information better.

00:57: And then I've got something else somewhere 
else here, there is this bird right there,

01:01: I just don't like him.

01:03: So I'll go ahead and drag something around him as 
well, and drag this cursor to a different location.

01:10: If you ever think better of one of your Spot 
Healings here and you want to get rid of it,

01:15: then you press the Alt key or the Option key 
on the Mac and click on the item in order

01:19: to delete it, but in my case I liked it, so 
I'll go ahead and press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z

01:23: on the Mac in order to regain that Spot Healing.

01:27: You can also turn off your Overlays by the way, 
and you do that either by deselecting

01:32: this checkbox, or by pressing the V key, 
as you can see in that tooltip.

01:36: All right, the next tool over 
is the Red Eye Removal tool.

01:39: If you have red eye inside one of your 
photographs, then just go and select the tool,

01:44: click on the pupil, cross your 
fingers, and hope for the best.

01:46: All right, now I'm going to switch over to 
the first thumbnail, Glanum ruins, and

01:50: I've already applied a few basic 
modifications to this image.

01:54: To check them out, by the way, if you ever 
want to switch back to the standard panel set,

01:58: then you just tap the Z key in order to 
select the Zoom tool, which is the default

02:03: tool inside of Camera Raw, and all 
of your options will be reinstated.

02:07: And we can see that I modified the Shadows and 
the Highlights and so forth inside this image.

02:12: And originally, by the way, this 
image was in pretty bad shape.

02:15: If I switch over to Snapshots, you can see 
that I've created a bunch of Snapshots over

02:18: time for this image, 
including Default settings.

02:21: This is what the image looked like when 
I first opened it, so pretty darn ugly.

02:26: Now it looks like this.

02:27: If you click on ACR7 conversion.

02:28: All right, now I'm going to switch back to my 
Basic panel, and what I want to do is brighten

02:34: up this foreground even more, and also neutralize 
the sky, because thanks to the fact that

02:41: I cranked up the Temperature value in order to 
reinstate the natural colors of these pillars,

02:46: I ended up making the neutral 
portion of the clouds really super brown.

02:50: So we need to take care of both of these items, and 
we're going to do so using the Graduated Filter.

02:55: So you can get to it by pressing the G key.

02:57: And then I'm going to drag from right about 
here up to here, like so, and I was pressing

03:03: the Shift key during that drag so I 
have a perfectly vertical gradient.

03:08: Green represents the beginning of the 
modification and red represents the end, and of course

03:12: it gradually dissipates 
in the area in between.

03:15: Now, you may end up getting a warning telling 
you that you need to modify some value here

03:21: inside the Graduated Filter panel.

03:23: Go ahead and do so and then try 
to draw your gradient again.

03:27: Now, all I'm seeing is the last stuff I was 
messing around with, none of which has anything

03:32: to do with this image.

03:33: So I'm going to go ahead 
and zero out these values.

03:35: And what's amazing about 
this is that you can do it.

03:38: So you can't create a gradient until you 
enter some values, but then after you've created

03:42: the gradient, you can go ahead and zero out the 
values which doesn't make any sense, but there it is.

03:47: I'm going to take that Exposure value 
up to 0.5 by pressing Shift+Up Arrow.

03:52: And then I'm going to take the Contrast value down in 
order to brighten up the scene a little bit more.

03:59: And I'm going to take the Shadows value up, 
let's say, to +50, and then I'll take the

04:04: Clarity value up to +50 as well, so that we 
emphasize the effect of these ancient carved pillars.

04:12: And then finally I'm going to 
change the Temperature value.

04:14: So much of this by the way is new to Camera 
Raw 7, in particular the fact that you can

04:20: change Temperature and Tint, which we've 
needed for a long time, where the Graduated Filter

04:25: and the Adjustment Brush are concerned, 
so this is really welcome stuff here.

04:30: All right, so that takes care of the pillars, 
now let's take care the sky, and I'm going

04:33: to drag from right about here downward, like so, until 
we meet up with the end of the previous gradient.

04:41: And you know what, I'm going to take it all the 
way down to the bottom of the sky, what the heck!

04:45: All right.

04:46: And all I need to do here, I'm going to go 
ahead and zero out these values, because

04:48: I'm not interested in darkening the sky or brightening 
the sky, I want to take this Temperature value

04:53: down, and I'm going to take it down to -50, a 
point at which the sky looks pretty darn neutral.

05:01: So just to give you a sense of what we were 
able to accomplish, I'll press the V key in

05:06: order to hide the Overlays, and of course you 
can just press V to bring them back again.

05:10: And then I'll turn off the Preview checkbox.

05:11: And the Preview checkbox by the way controls the 
display of just those settings in the active panel.

05:18: So in other words, I'm just temporarily 
turning off the Graduated Filter and nothing more,

05:22: and now I'll turn it back on, and we have 
what I consider to be a much better effect.

05:27: And so now I'm going to press the Z key in 
order to switch back to the Zoom tool, so

05:30: I get back all my panels.

05:31: I'll switch over to Snapshots.

05:33: I'll go ahead and click on the Page icon and 
I'll call this Graduated ACR7, because this

05:40: is the newest version of this effect for me.

05:43: And now, just to give you a sense of how far 
we've come with this image since I first opened

05:47: it, here are the Default settings, oh just terrible, 
and here is the effect of the work that we've done.

05:54: So that's how you work with the Spot 
Removal tool, as well as the Graduated Filter.

05:58: In the next movie I'll show you how to work 
with the most complex of the tools, which

06:02: is the Adjustment Brush.


 ** Painting edits with the Adjustment Brush

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to work with 
the Adjustment Brush which allows you to brush

00:04: in White Balance as well as Luminance 
modifications here inside Camera Raw.

00:09: Now in this case, I am looking at an image 
called Spanishtown dinosaurs and I've taken

00:13: a swing at adjusting the Exposure 
settings as well as the White Balance.

00:17: So if you switch over to Snapshots, you'll 
see right at the top Default settings,

00:21: that's how the image started terribly backlit, 
everything is black in the foreground, but there is

00:26: a ton of detail going on that we can 
draw out using that Adjustment Brush.

00:30: So I'll switch back to the ACR7 conversion, 
switch over to the Basic panel here, and

00:35: I'll grab my Adjustment Brush.

00:37: Now we've got a ton of settings associated 
with the brush here and I should go ahead

00:41: and reinstate Size and Feather to the 
defaults just so you can see how they work.

00:46: Thing is, all of these settings from Color up 
are dynamic, in other words you can modify

00:52: them after brushing in an effect.

00:55: But everything from Size down is static and only 
affects the brush stroke that you're about to draw.

01:01: You can change your brush stroke on-the-fly 
by the way by pressing the Bracket keys.

01:05: So I am going to press the Right Bracket key 
key a few times in order to increase the

01:08: Size to 18 and you can also change the 
Feather using the Bracket keys, but it works just

01:14: the opposite as it does in Photoshop.

01:16: So if you press Shift+] you make the brush softer 
because you're raising the Feather value.

01:22: If you press Shift+[ you're making the brush 
harder because you're reducing that value.

01:27: I am going to set that Feather value to 50.

01:30: Now Flow controls how the dollops of paint 
interact with each other, you will probably

01:34: want to leave that set to 50, and Density 
amounts to opacity, I recommend you leave

01:38: that set to 100% because it seems to me, at 
least in my experience, I always want an opaque

01:43: brush and then if I want to dial down the settings 
to make things more subtle, I will. All right.

01:48: So I've already got a setting here, Temperature 
of 50, I am going to go ahead and get rid

01:52: of it and then I'll paint inside of the image and 
I did that so I could show you this error message.

01:59: Notice if you've zeroed out all the way then 
you can't paint a brushstroke just as you

02:03: can't create a graduated filter.

02:05: So I'll go ahead and dial-in an Exposure 
setting, and it happens to be 0.8 by the way.

02:10: And then I'll scroll down and turn on these 
two checkboxes, Auto Mask, which will go ahead

02:15: and automatically paint just inside 
the darkest regions as you will see.

02:19: So it masks the brushstroke on-the-fly, 
it's a really great feature.

02:23: I wish like crazy it existed outside in the 
larger world of Photoshop and then we've got

02:28: Show Mask which will allow us to see 
our mask as we paint it. All right.

02:32: So notice now as I paint inside the dinosaur, 
that it's automatically masking the brushstroke

02:38: inside the dinosaur. Wouldn't it be great if something 
like the Quick Selection tool worked as well.

02:43: And now I'll paint down the legs of the 
tyrannosaurus like so and into his little hands as well,

02:50: and then I'll paint a little bit inside the 
triceratops, like so, and I might reduce the

02:55: size of my brush a little bit and 
paint in his face. All right.

02:59: That's the region that you want to paint, 
and this guy right there by the way, this

03:02: little pin that represents the entirebrushstroke 
because we have been adding to it the entire

03:07: time as you can see indicated by 
this Add radio button. All right.

03:11: Now I'll turn off Show Mask so I can see what I am 
doing, and I am going to modify a few settings here.

03:17: I am going to take the Shadows value up to 30 
in order to further brighten the dinosaurs,

03:22: and I'll take the Clarity value up to 20 
because I want to emphasize their metallic skin,

03:28: and then notice we've got all these blue regions 
inside of the tyrannosaurus in particular

03:32: because the sky is reflecting 
off him, I want those to go away.

03:36: So I am going to take my Temperature value 
up to 50 and that ends up giving us a nice

03:41: sort of bronzish dinosaur, which is 
exactly what I'm looking for. All right.

03:45: Now I want to darken the sky.

03:47: So I am going to switch back over here to 
the Graduated Filter tool and just to avoid

03:51: some confusion I am going to turn the Show 
Overlay checkbox back on, so I can see the

03:55: gradient as I draw it, then I'll go ahead 
and drag from up-left to downright like so

04:01: and maybe at a little more of an angle, and I 
am applying those last settings that I applied

04:04: using the Adjustment Brush.

04:06: So we'll go ahead and modify them here.

04:08: I'll set the Temperature to 0, and then I am 
going to take the Exposure down by pressing

04:13: Shift+Down Arrow a couple of times and 
then Down Arrow a couple of times more.

04:16: So the Exposure value I 
am looking for is -0.3.

04:20: And then I'll take the Contrast value up 
actually to +50, tab my way down to Shadows,

04:27: change that to 0, and Clarity wants to be +30, 
I think in order to pull off this effect properly,

04:33: and now I'll create another gradient from 
this angle and I'll go ahead and modify the

04:38: settings a little bit.

04:39: I am going to take the Exposure value down to -0.7.

04:42: I'll take the Contrast value up to 100 
and otherwise this is fine. All right.

04:48: Now I have managed to darken the tyrannosaurus's 
face some more, so I am going to follow it up

04:52: by painting another adjustment 
using the Adjustment Brush.

04:56: So I'll go ahead and grab it and I want to 
make sure that I am creating a new adjustment,

05:00: so I'll turn on the New checkbox.

05:01: We want to be working with those same Size 
and Feather values, Auto Mask should be turned

05:06: on, I'll turn on Show Mask as well and then 
I'll paint over the animal's face like this

05:12: and down into his mouth a 
little bit and across his back.

05:16: And by the way, if you end up going too far 
like down in this region or something like that,

05:20: you can erase and you can do so by turning 
on the Erase radio button or more easily

05:26: you just press and hold the Alt key 
or the Option key on the Mac.

05:28: The problem is, notice these Size and Feather 
values, as soon as I move my cursor out into

05:33: the image, you can see that those values 
change to those that are specified for the eraser,

05:39: which I don't want.

05:39: So there is an override.

05:41: You can go up to the flyout menu icon here 
and choose Separate Eraser Size to turn that

05:46: option off and now when you press the Alt 
key or the Option key on the Mac, you keep

05:50: those same Size and Feather values as 
I am doing right here. All right.

05:55: Once you have painted in something you like, 
go ahead and turn Show Mask off and let's

05:59: dial-in some better settings here.

06:02: This time around I want an 
Exposure that's much higher than this.

06:05: So I am going to press Shift+Up Arrow four 
times in a row to change the value to +0.8

06:11: and then I'll tab down to the Contrast value, 
change that to 0 and we want Highlights to be 0,

06:16: we want Shadows to be +30 I think, and then I'm 
going to take the Clarity value down to 0 like so.

06:24: And now it seems to me that I might be 
going a little bit too far with that.

06:28: So let's try taking the Exposure value down 
just a little bit and that to me at +0.45

06:35: ends up looking better. All right.

06:37: Let's get a sense of what 
we've accomplished here.

06:39: You can turn-off the Preview checkbox, but 
that will just turn-off the Adjustment Brushes,

06:43: it won't turn-off the graduated 
filters, and then I'll turn them back on.

06:47: Those Adjustment Brushes by 
themselves made a big difference.

06:50: I'll switch back to the Zoom tool which I 
could have done by pressing the Z key, switch

06:54: back over here to Snapshots, let's go ahead 
and click on the Page icon and I'll call this

06:59: ACR7 local adjustments let's say, and then 
click OK, and finally, I'll click on Default

07:06: Settings just so we can see what a train 
wreck this image was in the first place.

07:11: And I'll click on local adjustments 
and we can see how great it is now.

07:15: Thanks to the power of the Adjustment Brush 
working together with the Graduated Filter

07:19: tool here inside Camera Raw.


 ** Tone Curves (and why you don't need them)

00:00: In this movie I'll introduce you to the next 
panel over here inside Camera Raw and that's

00:04: Tone Curve, and it allows you to apply 
an aftermarket curve to your image.

00:09: So in other words, after you get done truly 
developing your image here inside the Basic panel,

00:14: then you can go over to Tone Curve and 
add the equivalent of a curves adjustment

00:19: layer, but I'm showing you 
this with the big caveat.

00:21: The thing is, thanks to the way that the 
exposure controls work inside Camera Raw 7,

00:28: you don't really need the tone curve function 
anymore, and I'll show you exactly what I mean.

00:33: So we'll start things off where I left off 
this image in Camera Raw 6, and so, because

00:38: I last developed the image in Camera Raw 6, 
we're seeing the old exposure controls along

00:42: with this exclamation point (!) down here in 
the bottom right corner of the image preview.

00:47: And even though I have thrown a graduated 
filter on top of things here, in order to

00:52: increase the contrast of this upper background,
I still felt like I had some brightening to

00:57: do where this image is concerned.

00:59: So I'll press the Z key to escape out, 
so I can gain access to my panels once again,

01:04: and I'll switch over to Tone Curve.

01:05: Now you've got two different variations on 
the curve here that you can heap on top of

01:10: each other if you want, so 
they operate independently.

01:13: We've got Parametric which I'll show in a 
moment and then we have Point, which is that

01:17: familiar version of the curve that we saw 
in the previous chapter, where you click

01:21: to set a point then you drag 
it around and so forth.

01:24: You can also see that bouncing ball inside of 
the graph by pressing and holding the

01:29: Ctrl key or the Cmd key on the Mac that gets 
you this eyedropper cursor on the fly and

01:33: then you just move the cursor 
around, you don't have to drag.

01:36: In order to see the bouncing ball, if you click, 
you'll go ahead and set a point inside of the graph.

01:43: So that will be a Ctrl+Click on a PC 
or Cmd+Click on the Mac.

01:46: I decided not to apply this kind of curve 
however, so I'll go ahead and reset that diagonal

01:50: line by choosing Linear from the Curve pop-up 
menu and then I'll switch back to Parametric.

01:56: The benefit of these options is that they 
allow you to modify specific areas of the

02:01: curves independently.

02:02: For example, I can crank up the shadows 
value in order to lift the first quarter of the

02:07: curve, which is going to brighten 
the quarter-tones inside of my image.

02:11: Now I don't want to go that high, so 
I'll change the Shadows value to 85.

02:15: I decided I wanted to lend some heft to some 
of the other darker shades, so I took the

02:21: Darks value down to -10 and then I went up 
to the Highlights value and took it up to 50,

02:26: let's say, and that raises the last quarter of 
the curve, which brightens the three-quarter tones.

02:33: You can also define what you mean by Highlights 
and Shadows and Midtones by dragging these

02:38: slider triangles.

02:39: So for example, I can compress my Highlights 
by moving this right-hand triangle to 85 and

02:45: then I can scoop my Midtones over and I took 
them up to 65, in the case of this particular

02:51: correction, and then I went ahead and took 
my Shadows all the way up to 40, which means

02:57: a larger portion of the image is being effected 
by the Shadows values and I ended up coming

03:02: up with a pretty decent correction.

03:04: Thing is, I can do better with less work now in 
Camera Raw 7, and let me show you what I mean by that.

03:10: I'll go ahead and switch back to the Basic 
panel and let's clear out everything we've

03:14: done, because I've already 
saved it out as a snapshot.

03:17: By going over here to the panel flyout menu 
and choosing Camera Raw Defaults, which will

03:21: clear out all the settings as well as a 
graduated filter and the tone curve by the way,

03:26: and we'll see the image as it was captured, 
which is extremely dark as you can see here.

03:32: Even though this is four second exposure, I 
had the ISO setting set very low, so that

03:36: I get as little noise as possible.

03:38: All right, so now that I'm seeing my Camera 
Raw 7 Exposure controls, I'll go ahead and

03:43: crank this Exposure value up to 2.00, so 
I'll press Shift+Up Arrow four times in a row.

03:50: Next I wanted to mitigate the enthusiasm of 
these lights in the background, so I'm going

03:54: to go ahead and drag this Whites value all 
the way down to -100, so we can recover as

04:00: much of the light as possible and you can 
see that makes a big difference, we now have

04:04: more subtle specular highlights, and I'm also 
going to press the Alt key or the Opt key

04:09: on the Mac and drag the black triangle down 
until I see just a little bit of clipping

04:14: there inside the image preview,
which happens at about -10.

04:17: All right, now I'd like to dim these lights 
a little further, so keep your eye on them

04:22: as I reduce the Highlights value to its absolute 
minimum of -100 and then I'm going to crank

04:29: the Shadows value to its absolute maximum of +100 
and we end up coming up with this developed image.

04:37: Now just one more step, I need to adjust the 
color Temperature because the scene is too warm,

04:40: you can do that using the White Balance tool 
of course, and you can get to the White

04:45: Balance tool one more way 
that I haven't shown you.

04:47: You can press and hold the Shift key, when 
you're using any other tool, that'll give

04:51: you White Balance tools and then I'll click on 
the brow of this boat right there and that'll

04:55: set the Temperature to 2750, which is very 
low, but that will compensate and cool down

05:01: the image as you see it.

05:03: And you know what, I think maybe the image 
could use a little more contrast, so I'll

05:07: go ahead and crank this guy up to say +20 and that 
looks like a great development of the image to me.

05:13: All right, now just for the sake of comparison 
I'll switch over to my Snapshots and I'll

05:18: create a New Snapshot by clicking on the little 
page icon and I'll call this guy ACR7 development

05:25: and then click OK and now we can compare the two 
versions, that is the one that takes advantage

05:30: of the tone curve along with the graduated 
filter, that I was able to pull off with a

05:34: fair amount of work inside of 
Camera Raw 6, and there it is.

05:39: Compare that to the better version of the 
image that I was able to achieve using just

05:44: the Exposure controls 
along with White Balance.

05:47: No tone curve needed here inside Camera Raw 7.

05:51: So now you know two things, how to use the 
tone curve, and that you'll probably

05:55: never need to.


 ** Straighten, crop, and geometric distortions

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to straighten, 
crop, and correct for Geometric Distortions

00:05: inside Camera Raw.

00:06: Now Camera Raw's Straightening Crop tool is 
pretty straightforward, you'll figure them

00:10: out quickly enough.

00:11: But there are times where no matter how much 
you try to straighten an image, it still looks

00:15: crooked, either because of Lens Distortion 
or because there's just enough perspective

00:20: in the shot to mess it up.

00:22: And this image is a case in point, San Simeon 
pool.dng is a famous swimming pool from the

00:27: William Randolph Hearst's Estate.

00:30: Appeared in all kinds of movies, I shot it at high 
noon, so there's a terrific amount of contrast.

00:35: So the first thing I did was cool it down 
by establishing some basic settings here,

00:39: and I went ahead and saved out 
those settings as a snapshot.

00:42: You can access that snapshot from the Snapshots 
panel or you can click on the flyout menu

00:46: icon, and then choose Apply 
Snapshot and then ACR7 conversion.

00:52: And that will go ahead and temper the contrast 
and take some of the heat out of the shot.

00:56: Now we want to straighten it and 
I'll do so using the Straighten tool.

01:00: Now this is a pretty good tool. It's not as 
good as Photoshop's Straighten tool, frankly,

01:03: because you just have one shot at it.

01:06: That is to say, you can't 
draw the line and then edit it.

01:09: And it's not very obvious where the hotspot of the 
cursor is, it's actually in the lower-left corner.

01:15: So I'll start at this location here and then 
drag to the right side of the base of these steps,

01:19: and that ends up automatically creating 
a crop boundary, as well as switching you

01:24: to the Crop tool.

01:26: Now from this point on you can modify the 
crop boundaries, just as you can inside the

01:30: Photoshop, but you're seeing the image crooked 
and the image remains crooked until you switch

01:35: to a different tool.

01:36: Now if you want to change the Aspect Ratio of 
your crop boundary, you can click and hold

01:41: on the Crop tool like so, and choose one of these 
items or you can dial in the Custom ratio as well.

01:46: And you can also get to those very same controls 
by right-clicking inside of the crop boundary.

01:52: And notice among these options is Show Overlay,
and that'll go ahead and bring up those

01:57: gridlines that represent the rule of thirds.

02:00: And notice by the way as you adjust your crop 
boundary you can move it inward, but you can't

02:04: move it out beyond the edge of the image.

02:07: So in other words, Camera Raw insists 
upon clipping some of the image away.

02:11: Now assuming you like what you have, 
and I'm just fine with it,

02:15: go ahead and press the Z key to switch back 
to your default Zoom tool and then the image

02:19: will appear upright.

02:21: Problem is it doesn't really appear upright 
in all portions of the image, so in other

02:25: words this architectural item in the background 
looks just fine, but these lines in the foreground

02:31: are not plumb, that is P-L-U-M-B, perpendicular, 
instead they're set at angles and that's because

02:37: the shot has some perspective in it.

02:39: And that's where we need to 
correct for Geometric Distortion.

02:42: And there are two ways to pull that off.

02:44: One is automatically, and one is manually, so let 
me show you an automatic method for starters.

02:50: I'll go ahead and switch over to this image 
New York.dng and this is a photograph that

02:54: comes to us from Chris Orwig, a 
fellow trainer here at lynda.com.

02:59: And notice that it does have some 
barrel distortion associated with it.

03:03: So you can see this horizontal line up here 
at the top of the image bend upward in the

03:08: center, whereas, it should 
be absolutely horizontal.

03:11: All right, let's start off 
by correcting the image.

03:13: I'll click on the flyout menu icon, choose 
Apply Snapshot and then choose ACR7 conversion

03:19: and we end up with this brighter version of 
the scene, and then I'll switch over a few

03:23: panels to Lens Corrections, and by 
default you should see the Profile tab active.

03:28: Go ahead and turn on Enable Lens Profile 
Corrections and that's all there is to it.

03:33: Camera Raw immediately recognizes that this 
is a Canon EOS 5D and it also recognizes the

03:39: lens as well, and so it corrects not only 
for the distortion inside of the image, but

03:44: for the vignetting as well.

03:46: So if I turn off the Preview checkbox for a 
moment, you can see that the image bulges

03:50: outward once again, so we've got some barrel 
distortion associated with the scene,

03:55: and we've got some obvious dark 
vignetting around the perimeter.

03:58: Whereas, if I turn that Preview checkbox back on,
all of that goes away, we now have a straight

04:04: horizontal line across the top of the image.

04:06: It looks to match the angle of the top of 
the preview as well, so everything appears

04:10: to be exactly as it should be.

04:12: However, if it doesn't go far enough or it goes too 
far, then you can adjust the slider values here.

04:18: Right now they're both set to a correction 
amount of 100% apiece, but if you want less

04:25: correction, then you would go ahead and dial 
this value down and that's going to bring

04:29: back some of that barrel distortion.

04:31: If you want more correction, then you can 
dial this value up and we're going to get

04:35: some pin-cushioning going on here.

04:37: So now the line is bending slightly downward.

04:39: In the case of this image however, I found 
that 100% for both values work splendidly.

04:46: The problem is Camera Raw doesn't 
know what to do with all images.

04:50: For example, if I switch back to San Simeon pool 
and I turn on Enable Lens Profile Corrections,

04:55: even though it recognizes this image was shot 
with a Olympus E-30, it doesn't have the slightest

05:00: idea what to do with this image, and in fact, 
if I go ahead and click on the Make setting

05:05: here, Olympus is not even listed in the menu.

05:07: What that means is I'm going to have to 
correct this image manually, which actually turns

05:12: out to be a fair amount of fun, 
as we'll see in the next movie.


 ** Applying manual lens corrections

00:00: In this movie I'll show you a couple of different 
ways to correct for distortions, whether they're

00:04: caused by the lens element or the 
perspective of the scene here inside Camera Raw.

00:09: So I'm starting off inside the San Simeon 
pool image, I've switched over to the Lens

00:13: Correction panel and now I'll click in the Manual 
tab in order to bring up these options here.

00:18: Now the number one problem with the scene is that 
it's coming at us over here on the left-hand side.

00:25: So in other words the image is declining over 
to the right, and so what we need to do is

00:29: angle it toward us.

00:31: And we can see these little icons that are 
showing us which direction we need to move.

00:35: So in this case we need to move the right-hand 
side of the image toward us, so we need to

00:41: apply a positive modification 
to this horizontal value.

00:45: So I'll just go ahead and drag this triangle 
over to the right and obviously I've gone

00:48: too far at this point but you can see that it allows 
us to angle the image in the opposite direction.

00:54: I will go ahead and take this value down 
until it starts looking right, and my eye tells

00:59: me that a value of about +8 
is going to work out fine.

01:04: It also looks to me like the scene is sort 
of tilted toward us at the bottom here and

01:08: so I'm going to go ahead and just tweak 
this vertical value slightly down to -2.

01:14: And then finally it's hard to tell what kind 
of distortion we might have in this scene

01:18: that is whether we have pin-cushioning that we 
need to address with some barrel distortion

01:22: or whether we have barrel distortion inherent in the 
scene that we need to solve using some pin-cushioning.

01:28: But to me it looks like we need to barrel 
things just slightly, so I'll go ahead and

01:33: set that value to -2.

01:35: So altogether we've got -2, -2 and +8 for 
the Transform values, we don't need to modify

01:41: the Rotate value.

01:42: The image looks straight at this point.

01:44: And Scale isn't going to 
do us any good either.

01:46: All right, let's see another example 
that's sort of an opposite example.

01:50: I'll switch over to Interior pool and this is 
the pool on the inside of the Hearst Estate,

01:54: and of course the first thing that 
I would do is develop the image.

01:58: So I'll go up here to the flyout menu icon, 
once again choose Apply Snapshot and then

02:02: choose ACR7 conversion, and that gives us 
a world of better color inside the scene.

02:09: However, there's something 
up with it, something's off.

02:12: So possibly your first temptation is to go 
for the Straighten tool and draw a line along

02:18: the bottom edge of this wall here which 
is tipping slightly up and to the left.

02:23: So I'll go ahead and release and we get this 
crop boundary, fine, and then I'll just go

02:28: ahead and switch back to the Zoom tool and 
that actually looks worse than it did before.

02:33: Now the ceiling is obviously off and 
so are the reflections in the water.

02:38: So I'm going to go ahead and press Ctrl+Z or 
Cmd+Z on the Mac to undo that change,

02:42: and I'm going to start things off once again 
by modifying the horizontal value, because

02:47: the perspective is the most 
obvious problem with the scene.

02:50: Now in this case the right side of the scene 
is declining away from us, so I need to tip

02:55: that left-half toward us by dragging the 
triangle to the left, and at about -8 we get a result

03:02: that I think looks right.

03:03: All right, now you can see that the image 
is bowing out toward us so we have a barrel

03:08: distortion associated with the scene.

03:10: And so that means I need to pincushion it 
and I'll do that by dragging this distortion

03:14: triangle to the right, and I'm going to set 
this value actually to +8 like so, and that

03:20: ends up flattening things quite nicely, and 
then I'm also going to just slightly tweak

03:25: this vertical value.

03:26: I'll take it down to -1 and we end up 
with this much better effect here.

03:31: Now you may recall where the 
San Simeon pool image was concerned.

03:34: I'd cropped this image before I said about 
correcting the distortion of the scene.

03:39: However, I did not crop the interior pool 
which is why we're seeing some gray edges

03:44: around the side, so you 
probably want to crop those away.

03:47: By switching to the Crop tool which you can 
get just as you can in Photoshop by pressing

03:51: the C key and then I'm just going to drag 
pretty much around the entire scene like this

03:55: and then Camera Raw will go ahead and 
snap that boundary inside the image.

03:59: Now if that's not what you want then you can 
right-click inside the image and turn off

04:03: Constrain to Image.

04:05: Now for whatever reason this command has no 
effect on an image that is not distorted,

04:10: so you have to actually apply a Lens 
Correction before you can take advantage of it.

04:15: In any case I'll go ahead and choose it just 
to show you how it works, and now notice

04:19: that I can move the crop boundary outside to 
reveal empty portions of the image,

04:24: those areas will appear as white if 
I open the image in Photoshop.

04:27: However, I don't want that to happen, so I'll 
go ahead and right-click and choose Constrain

04:31: to Image to move that crop boundary inside 
the image once again, and then I'll press

04:36: the Z key in order to assign that crop.

04:39: All right, so just to give you a sense 
of how different these images look.

04:43: I'll go ahead and click on the flyout 
menu icon and choose Camera Raw Defaults.

04:48: This is the original version of the scene 
before I developed it or straightened it,

04:53: and this is the after version.

04:55: Meanwhile if I switch down to San Simeon pool 
and do the same thing, I'll go ahead and choose

05:00: Camera Raw Defaults once again, this is the 
original version of this scene and then this

05:05: is the developed and 
straighten version of the scene.

05:08: Thanks to the power of the Manual Lens 
Correction controls here inside Camera Raw.


 ** Vignette, chromatic aberration, and fringe

00:00: In this movie we'll visit three pests of the 
photographic arts, specifically vignettes,

00:06: chromatic aberration, and color fringing, and 
I'll show you how to correct for them as well.

00:11: Notice that we're revisiting a handful of 
images here, starting with Interior pool.dng,

00:17: and you can see the vignetting, which is the 
darkness around the perimeter, cast by the

00:21: lens element onto the scene.

00:23: So to get rid of it, I'll go ahead and switch 
to the Lens Corrections panel, and because

00:27: I last left off in the Manual tab,
it's ready and waiting for me.

00:31: Notice down here at the bottom we have 
a couple of Lens Vignetting options.

00:34: If you move this Amount triangle to the left, 
you're going to add darkness to the scene,

00:39: so that would be how you correct for a bright 
vignette; more likely though, you're going

00:43: to want to brighten things up to 
account for a dark vignette, like so.

00:48: So I'm going to start by cranking this value 
up to a 100, which is too far, but I want

00:52: to demonstrate how the Midpoint works.

00:54: If you increase the Midpoint, then you're going 
to reduce the size of the vignette correction,

00:58: so that goes ahead and tucks that 
brightness toward the corners.

01:02: If you want to expand the size, 
then you decrease the Midpoint.

01:06: In my case however, I want to go ahead and 
leave that Midpoint set to 50 and I'm going

01:10: to back off the Amount until I get a more 
reasonable effect; I really want absolute

01:14: neutrality where the 
wandering luminance is concerned.

01:18: So I'll go ahead and take the 
Amount down to +40. All right.

01:21: So vignetting is pretty common, not 
really conceptually challenging either.

01:25: Chromatic aberrations are 
a little bit different.

01:27: I'm going to switch over to the San Simeon 
pool image and I'm going to zoom into the

01:31: top of this facade.

01:32: Now, while you may never have heard of chromatic aberrations,
once you see them, you can recognize them like crazy.

01:39: They're these wandering edge colors right 
there, where essentially the color channels

01:43: aren't lining up properly with each other.

01:46: And so in this case, we've got kind of this 
magenta along the top of the corners and then

01:51: we're seeing the complementary color, 
this kind of cyan on the other side.

01:57: Once upon a time you had to drag sliders around 
inside Photoshop in order to solve these things,

02:02: now it's super easy.

02:04: You just switch over to this Color panel here 
and you turn on this checkbox, Remove Chromatic

02:09: Aberration, and they go away, 
that's all there is to it.

02:12: And what's amazing about this, I just 
love that it's so simple to do now.

02:16: If it's that simple though, why isn't it turned on by 
default, why doesn't it just automatically happen?

02:21: Because these things can drive you nuts, you'll 
see them in your photographs like five years

02:25: later and you failed to correct 
them and you have to go back.

02:29: Speaking of not having corrected something, 
I'm going to zoom out from this image here

02:33: and I'm going to go ahead and scroll down 
and I'm seeing these steps are not actually

02:38: straight, and I also have a little bit of 
distortion still associated with the scene.

02:44: If I go ahead and drag down to these bottom 
pool lines, you can see that they're actually

02:49: curving, notice that I've got some 
barrel distortion at work here.

02:52: So I'm going to switch back over to 
Manual and I came up with some new values.

02:55: But notice if I change any one of these here, 
for example, let's say I go ahead and drag

03:01: on this Distortion value in order to increase 
it to +12 is what I ended up coming up with,

03:07: because it needed some pin cushioning and so 
that straightens out that pool line there.

03:12: As soon as I release, Camera Raw goes ahead 
and zooms me out, and so you have to make

03:16: these corrections backed out like this and then 
you have to zoom in to see if you got it right.

03:21: So I'll save us all a lot of headache here 
and just dial in the values that I came up

03:24: with after way too much work frankly.

03:27: But I'm going to dial in a Rotate value of 
0.4 in order to rotate the scene slightly

03:33: clockwise and then I'm going to take that 
Horizontal value down to +6; ends up working out better.

03:39: And now you can see, if I go ahead and drag 
with the Zoom tool in order to zoom into this

03:45: detail right here, I'll go ahead and drag 
it down, you can see that it's now flat so

03:49: that took care of that problem.

03:51: And these pool lines here of course, they're 
declining, there's nothing we can do about

03:55: them, because this is 
the deep end of the pool.

03:57: And now I'll go ahead and drag the stairs 
down to the bottom and they are straight too.

04:03: So that takes care of that.

04:04: All right, a couple of different 
examples of chromatic aberration here.

04:07: I'm going to switch to Lighthouse-2 and zoom 
in to the top of it and we'll take it in at

04:13: 200% and you can see that we've got a little 
bit of chromatic aberration at work up here,

04:18: along with some fringing.

04:20: So I'm going to switch back over to Color 
and I'm going to turn on Remove Chromatic

04:24: Aberration and that will take care of 
those wandering colors along the top there.

04:28: But we still have an issue, if you take a 
close look here at these bars, they've got

04:33: these kind of purple edges going on, 
and that is the Color Fringing at work.

04:38: And now inside Camera Raw 7 
we can address that fringing.

04:41: I'm going to go ahead and increase the Purple Amount to 
10 and that takes care of that problem, as you can see.

04:46: Now, you may be tempted to try to get rid 
of some of the blue fringing as well,

04:52: and you can do that by the way by 
increasing the range of Purple.

04:57: So if I go ahead and drag this triangle over, 
for example, to include blue then those edges

05:02: are going to go away, but 
we've got bigger problems.

05:05: We have too much defringing going on, which 
frankly can look way worse than the color fringing.

05:12: So I'm going to go ahead and back this value 
off to 26, that's the value before the slash,

05:17: and that pretty well seems to 
take care of the problem there.

05:21: Now I'm going to switch over to Glanum ruins 
and zoom in to these details right there,

05:26: and you can see that we have a whole lot of 
aberrations going on where this image is concerned

05:30: and a lot of purple and green fringing.

05:33: So I'm going to turn on Remove Chromatic 
Aberration to take care of much of it, but we still have

05:38: a little fringing at work as you can see.

05:40: So I'll increase that Purple Amount to 10, 
let's say, and then I'll take the Green Amount

05:45: all the way to 20, I think will work out, and 
that definitely makes these details look better.

05:51: Question is, is this going to work everywhere?

05:53: So I'll go ahead and zoom out by pressing 
Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0 on the Mac, and then I

05:58: will zoom in on these details.

06:01: And notice this time around that getting 
rid of the fringing has left white spots.

06:07: So if I turn the Preview checkbox off, this 
is how things used to look, obviously quite bad,

06:11: but when I turn the Preview checkbox 
back on, it's as if Camera Raw doesn't know

06:16: what to make of this area, doesn't know that 
that's part of the sky, and so this area ends

06:21: up getting filled with white.

06:23: And we have a similar problem over against this 
edge and traveling upward a little bit as well.

06:28: So I decided ultimately that there's no 
perfect solution, but I was going to go ahead and

06:33: take the Green Amount down 
to 10 instead. All right.

06:37: Well, go ahead and zoom out by 
pressing Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0 on the Mac.

06:41: And that, friends, is how you address vignettes, 
chromatic aberration, and color fringing here

06:46: inside Camera Raw 7.


 ** Selective hue, saturation, and luminance

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to selectively 
modify the Hue Saturation and Luminance properties

00:05: of specific ranges of colors.

00:08: I'm working inside a file called Canal boat.dng,
I have just one image open, which is why

00:12: I am not seeing the vertical strip of 
thumbnails over there on the left-hand screen.

00:16: I will start by developing the image, so I 
will click on this flyout menu icon, choose

00:20: Apply Snapshot and then choose ACR7 conversion, and we 
end up getting this much more vibrant photograph.

00:27: All right, I am going to zoom in on Colleen 
here and beautiful as she is, she does have

00:32: some problems going on.

00:33: She's got this little bit of pink at the top 
of her ear and then she's got some purple

00:38: round her eyes and those are once again indications 
of Chromatic Aberration and Color Fringing,

00:45: which you are going to run into a lot.

00:47: So we might as well solve those problems 
right now, by switching over to Lens Correction

00:51: panel, making sure that the color tab is active, 
then I will turn on Remove Chromatic Aberration

00:57: and that gets rid of a lot 
of our problems right away.

01:00: We still have a little bit of purple around 
the eyes though, so I am going to increase

01:04: that Purple Amount value to 
10 and everything clears up.

01:08: At least where Colleen is concerned, and if 
I zoom out here, we've got a weird problem

01:13: associated with this boat.

01:15: Notice that we have these dark edges around some of 
the details and they really shouldn't be there.

01:22: Now we can't correct those edges using 
Defringe, so I will switch a couple of panels

01:26: over to HSL grayscale, and notice we have the 
sub-panels Hue, Saturation, and Luminance.

01:32: Now remember back in the Fundamentals Course, 
Chapter 8, when I was showing you how to use

01:36: the Hue/Saturation Adjustment, we were able 
to selectively modify those spray cans using

01:42: the Target Adjustment tool.

01:43: So I Ctrl+Drag or Cmd+Drag down that green 
spray can to change it to a totally different color.

01:49: Well that's the same idea behind these sliders 
here, except that in one regard we have more

01:54: control, because we have more colors to work with.

01:57: We don't have cyan, but we do have an 
addition of Oranges, Aquas and Purples.

02:03: On the other hand we have a more limited 
range of Hues on a slider by slider basis.

02:08: So you can change your Aquas from Green to 
Blue, but you can't change them to say Red.

02:13: And the idea here is where Camera Raw is 
concerned, we are not going for a special effect,

02:19: we are trying to correct the photograph.

02:21: So I am going to switchover to the Target 
Adjustment tool, which you can get by pressing

02:24: the T key and because the Hue panel is up, the 
tool immediately switches its behavior to Hue.

02:31: If I were to choose Saturation instead, that 
would actually switch me to the Saturation tab,

02:35: and if I were to choose Parametric Curve, 
that would switch me to the Tone Curve panel.

02:41: Anyway, I want to be working on Hues of course,
so I will switch back and now I'll go ahead

02:46: and click and drag inside the Blue.

02:48: Now you can scrub side to side or up and down,
it's totally up to you, but once you begin

02:54: dragging you make a sort of commitment.

02:56: So for example, when I start the drag, I see, 
I can go in any direction, but once I drag

03:01: to the right for example, to make those Blues 
sort of Purple, then I see this back and forth

03:05: arrow cursor, indicating that I 
now have to drag horizontally.

03:08: Okay, in this case, I have gone ahead and 
made my Blues and my Purple, so instead of

03:13: sticking to a single range of colors, the 
way that Hue/Saturation command does,

03:18: any changes you make with the Target Adjustment 
tool here inside Camera Raw, can bleed over

03:22: into multiple values, so I'm 
changing both my Blues and my Purples.

03:27: Anyway, I am losing those strips, which is 
great, but I don't want the boat to be Purple.

03:31: In fact, I don't want it to look much 
different color wise than it did before.

03:35: So I'm going to drag back over here to the 
left this time and those lines come back and

03:41: then they start going away at a Blues 
value of -10, as you can see here.

03:46: All right, I am going to go ahead and reinstate 
my Purples value to 0, because we don't need

03:50: to change any of the Purples.

03:52: And I'll zoom out a little bit, so that we can 
take in the scene and see what I've managed

03:56: to do across the entire scene,
which is very important.

03:58: So I will turn off the Preview checkbox, those 
stripes come back, we don't want them of course,

04:04: we're also seeing the color of this boat in 
the background change a little bit and there

04:08: are some Blues inside the cars, in the 
reflections on the camera and so forth.

04:12: Anyway, I can live with those, so I will press 
the P key to turn the Preview checkbox back on.

04:17: All right, now let's make some 
Saturation and Luminance Adjustments.

04:20: I will click on the Saturation tab and that's 
all it takes to change the behavior of the

04:25: Target Adjustment tool.

04:27: It now changes to Saturation as well, 
as you can see here in the pop-up menu.

04:31: And so, what I want to do this time is 
slightly reduce the Saturation of that scarf, so I'm

04:36: going to drag this time down let's say, and 
notice that I get a up down cursor instead,

04:40: if I drag up, I am going to increase the 
Saturation of not only the scarf, but of all the Red

04:45: details and Colleen's face as well,
which is pretty unfortunate.

04:49: So let's not do that.

04:50: I will go ahead and drag down until I reduce 
the Reds value to -10 as you can see over

04:56: here in the Saturation panel.

04:58: I have also affected the Magentas, I don't think I 
really care about them, so I will set that to 0.

05:03: So notice I am making some pretty small 
modifications across the board here.

05:07: All right, let's finish 
things up with Luminance.

05:09: I want to make the blue boat darker, so I 
am going to click in the Blue and drag down

05:14: and I am going to take that Blues value to -20,
and again, I've affected Purple, so I'll

05:20: go and reset the Purples value to 0.

05:22: So -20 for Blue, for Luminance we've got -10, 
for Saturation for Reds, and we've got -10

05:30: for Blues for Hue, and we 
end up achieving this effect.

05:34: So I will turn the Preview checkbox off, 
this is what the scene would look like without

05:37: those modifications and then I will press 
the P key to turn that checkbox back on, and

05:42: this is what the scene looks 
like with those modifications.

05:44: And by the way, the reason I took the 
Luminance of the Blues down a little bit is because

05:49: I wanted this boat to look more 
like it looked in the first place.

05:52: All right, I am going to press the Z key to 
switchback to the Zoom tool and zoom on in

05:56: once again on Colleen.

05:58: One last final trick that doesn't really have 
anything to do with what I've shown you so far,

06:02: let's say you want to see a before and 
after of everything you've done during a session

06:07: inside of Camera Raw, then you switch to the 
Snapshots panel, and now the Preview checkbox,

06:12: if I turn it off by pressing 
the P key, turns off everything.

06:16: So this is the original version of the image, 
before I developed it and before I applied

06:21: any of my other modifications.

06:23: And if I press the P key again, this 
is the finished version of the image.

06:27: In part, thanks to my ability to selectively 
modify the Hue, Saturation, and Luminance

06:33: on a color by color basis.


 ** Working with JPEG and TIFF images

00:00: In this movie, we'll talk about editing JPEG 
files inside Camera Raw and everything

00:05: I'll tell you works exactly 
the same with TIFF images.

00:08: Camera Raw does not allow you to open native PSD 
files, because it doesn't support layers. All right.

00:13: So I've selected this file called Brand new 
gloves.jpg in Bridge and if I want to open

00:18: it in Camera Raw I can either right-click on 
it and choose Open in Camera Raw or I can

00:22: just press Ctrl+R or Cmd+R on the Mac, 
and then Camera Raw comes up on screen and

00:27: everything looks pretty much just as it does 
when we are working on an actual RAW image,

00:32: but there are a few differences.

00:34: So I'm going to start things 
off by cropping this image.

00:36: I want to get rid of a lot of that sky, 
because it's a pretty crummy shape, and then

00:41: I'll drag down to the crook of Colleen's arm here.

00:43: I might keep a little more sky than that.

00:46: You can also by the way; to invoke a crop, 
you can press the Enter key or the Return

00:50: key on the Mac and that will 
send you back to the Zoom tool.

00:53: I prefer to press the Z key however, because I 
don't want to accidentally invoke the Done button.

00:58: Next I'll go ahead and click on Auto in 
order to apply some automatic modifications and

01:03: I'm going to go ahead and take that Exposure 
value slightly up to -0.65 and I would like

01:09: slightly more Contrast in this, 
so I'll take that value to 0.

01:13: The Highlights value is 
pretty close to what I want.

01:15: I ended up setting it to -40, and then I 
went ahead and increased the Shadows value all

01:20: the way to 100 in order to open up those shadows 
under the bridge, this being the Rialto in Venice.

01:27: Now you might figure that you could recover 
some of those clouds in the sky there by reducing

01:32: the Whites value, and sure enough that's going 
to go ahead and make those clouds or whatever

01:36: they are, a light gray, but it 
doesn't really recover them.

01:40: We have all kinds of posterization at work 
as you can see here, and there's not really

01:44: much we're going to do about that, 
not inside of Camera Raw anyway.

01:48: And the thing to bear in mind is, even though 
I was telling you that the Whites and Blacks

01:52: options frequently allow you to recover 
Highlights and Shadows that you otherwise thought were

01:57: clipped, that's not really the case with 
JPEGs and TIFFs, because they are flat files.

02:02: They don't have extra data that you're 
not seeing, the way that RAW files do.

02:07: So what I'm going to do here is press the 
Alt key or the Opt key on the Mac and drag

02:11: up on the White slider triangle until we're 
starting to see clipping and then I'm going

02:16: to come back here to about +20, works, and 
then I'll also Alt+Drag the Blacks value until

02:23: we see clipping in the Image window, which happens 
around -50, and we end up with this image here.

02:29: And if you feel like adding a little 
bit of saturation, by then go for it.

02:32: I'm going to take my Vibrance value up to 30; 
I might take the Saturation up to 15 as well.

02:38: All right.

02:38: Now notice up here at the top of the stack, 
we've got the Temperature value and instead

02:42: of reading 4000 degrees Kelvin or whatever, 
it's showing us 0 and that's because it's

02:49: no longer an absolute value, 
instead, it's a relative value.

02:53: So if you want to warm up the image, you add 
to the value and if you want to cool down

02:57: the image you subtract from it.

02:59: This value is also by the way not a degree 
value; it's more analogous to a percentage.

03:04: Anyway, I found that a value of about five 
ended up giving me the warmth I was looking for.

03:10: Now the final thing I want to do is take 
care of the sky, it's in just dreadful shape.

03:14: So I'm going to switch over to HSL/Grayscale, 
and I don't want a cyan sky, I can't remember

03:19: the last time I saw a 
sky that looks like this.

03:22: So I'm going to switch to the Targeted 
Adjustment tool, and because the Hue tab is live,

03:26: I'm going to modify the Hue and I'm going to do 
so by dragging to the right up here in this

03:31: Cyan region, and that's going to change both 
my Aquas and Blues values to a 100 eventually.

03:38: I don't think I really want my Blues values 
to be that high, so I'm going to take it down

03:42: to 0 and see what I end up getting, 
and this looks a lot better to me.

03:47: So an Aquas value of +100, a Blues value of 0.

03:51: Let's also modify the Luminance a little bit.

03:53: So I'll switch to the Luminance tab and I'll 
drag down from the sky and you can drag down

03:58: really far if you want to, and that will give 
you this wonderfully dramatic sky, but it's

04:03: awfully posterized as well.

04:05: So I ended up coming up with an Aquas value 
of about -35 and then I went ahead and took

04:10: the Blues value back down to 0, and 
we end up with this final effect.

04:15: Now you can either open the image in Photoshop 
and make some modifications, such as blurring

04:19: away that sky if you want to, or you can 
click the Done button and return to Bridge,

04:24: and that's what I'm going to do.

04:26: Now notice, as soon as we're back in the Bridge,
that we have these little icons here showing

04:31: us that first I cropped the image, and second 
I modified the settings inside Camera Raw.

04:37: That means from now on if I double-click inside 
this image, it's going to open in Camera Raw,

04:43: albeit this time hosted by Photoshop.

04:45: So the thing to remember is that once a JPEG 
or TIFF image is associated with Camera Raw data,

04:50: then it becomes a Camera Raw image. All right.

04:54: I'm going to escape out for a moment, because 
I want to show you a couple more things here.

04:59: I'll go to the File menu and choose Browse in 
Bridge or press Ctrl+Alt+O or Cmd+Opt+O

05:03: on the Mac to return to Bridge.

05:06: And note here inside the Metadata panel that 
you have your Camera Raw data, which shows

05:11: you that Camera Raw did not hurt 
a single pixel inside the image.

05:16: But you might say, well surely, it cropped 
the image at least, actually it didn't.

05:20: If I press Ctrl+R or Cmd+R on the Mac in 
order to open the image in Camera Raw and

05:25: I switch to the Crop tool, all the pixels 
are still there, which is utterly outstanding

05:30: by the way, because Photoshop is not capable 
of doing that with JPEG images. All right.

05:35: So I'll go ahead and click the 
Cancel button in order to escape out.

05:39: Finally, let's say you like Camera Raw so 
much, you like the way it's organized, that

05:44: you want to be able to use it to 
open all future JPEG and TIFF images.

05:50: Then go up to the Edit menu here in Bridge 
and choose Camera Raw Preferences and then

05:55: notice down here at the very bottom, JPEG and 
TIFF Handling, they are both set to Automatically

05:59: open whatever file format with settings, and 
that's what we just saw a moment ago, that

06:04: JPEG file has settings now, so it 
gets opened inside of Camera Raw.

06:09: You could, if you hate Camera Raw, say Disable 
JPEG support or if you love it, then you can

06:14: say Automatically open all supported JPEGs 
and Automatically open all supported TIFFs.

06:20: I'm not going to work that way, I'll just go 
ahead and click Cancel, because it's pretty

06:23: darn easy to just select a file and 
press Ctrl+R or Cmd+R on the Mac.

06:29: And that's how you open and edit both 
JPEG and TIFF images inside Camera Raw.


 ** Camera Raw Smart Objects

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to open an 
image from Camera Raw into Photoshop as an

00:05: editable Smart Object, so that you can 
revisit Camera Raw anytime you like.

00:10: So I've got this fairly dank 
image of the California coast here.

00:14: Fortunately, of course, Camera Raw is 
so fantastic that I can sweeten it.

00:18: So I'll go over to the flyout panel menu, 
choose Apply Snapshot and then choose ACR7

00:23: conversion, and we end up with 
this much more cheerful scene here.

00:27: All right, at this point I figured this 
would make a great black-and-white shot.

00:31: Now, we've already seen how to make a black-and-
white image in Camera Raw back in Chapter 20 of

00:36: the Intermediate course, so I'll move 
through the process pretty quickly here.

00:40: I'll switch to the HSL/Grayscale panel and 
then I'll turn on Convert to Grayscale,

00:46: which gets rid of all my other tabs and 
leaves me with just one grayscale mix.

00:50: Now, I don't care about the Reds value, its 
fine where it is, but I took the Oranges value

00:56: up to +50, because I wanted to emphasize the 
cliff walls, which are more of a muddy brown,

01:02: but that still falls in the Oranges category.

01:04: And I took the Yellows value up to 30, 
which helps brighten some of the foliage.

01:08: And I took the Greens value up to 15.

01:11: Then I took the Aquas value down to -35, 
which affects some of the ocean of course.

01:16: And I took the Blues value down to -100.

01:18: I really wanted it to be nice and dark.

01:21: And then I took the Purples value up to 20 and 
I ended up leaving the Magentas value alone.

01:26: All right, now let's go ahead 
and apply some Split Toning here.

01:30: Now, we need to start things off by increasing 
the Saturation value, so I'll take the first

01:34: one up to 30, and I'll take 
this second one up to 5.

01:39: Then I'll change the Hue value for Highlights 
to 45, so that we have a kind of sepia tone

01:44: going, and I'll take the Hue value for the 
Shadows up to 240, which lends the scene just

01:50: a little bit of dark blue.

01:53: And finally, I'll change this Balance so that 
we're waiting the colors on the side of the

01:57: Highlights as opposed to the Shadows, 
and we end up with this final scene.

02:01: All right, now take a look at the Open 
Image button at the bottom of the screen.

02:05: If you click on it, then you'll open the image 
inside of Photoshop and you'll also save your

02:09: new metadata settings to the DNG file.

02:12: If you press the Alt key or the Option key on 
the Mac and click on the Open button, you'll

02:17: open the image inside Photoshop, but you will 
not save your settings to the DNG file, so

02:23: the DNG file will be left entirely alone.

02:25: Sometimes useful, not a great idea in our case.

02:28: If you press the Shift key, you'll notice 
the button changes to Open Object and that's

02:33: telling you that you're going to open the 
image as a Smart Object in Photoshop,

02:37: and that's what I'm going to do.

02:38: So I'll Shift+Click on that Open Object button 
and a few moments later we end up seeing the

02:43: image opened here in Photoshop.

02:45: Then let's say you're just sort of looking 
around at the image, checking it out, and

02:50: you suddenly realize how blotchy it is, what 
in the world is going on with this blotchy

02:56: ocean, and you just can't even believe you didn't 
notice that when you were working inside Camera Raw.

03:02: And even though you may have spotted that 
problem at the time, you will encounter other

03:07: times where you think you've come up with 
some just great settings in Camera Raw

03:12: and then they turn out not too fare so well 
as you modify the image in Photoshop.

03:16: Well, fortunately, this layer is a Smart Object,
so all you have to do is double-click on its

03:20: thumbnail to open the image again inside Camera Raw.

03:25: Now I'll switch back over to my HSL/Grayscale 
settings and I'll go ahead and take this Aquas

03:30: value down to -40, let's say, and I'll tab 
to Blues and press Shift+Up Arrow until that

03:36: blotchiness goes away, which happens at -70.

03:40: And then I'll scoot ahead to the Purples value 
and I'll take it down to -40, because there

03:45: is some other sort of color issues at 
work here, and that helps to remedy them.

03:50: Now, if you take a look at the bottom of the 
screen here, you'll see we no longer have

03:54: an Open button, we now have an OK button, 
because all you can do at this point is either

03:59: Cancel out and not make any changes or 
click OK and return back to Photoshop.

04:04: The thing to remember is when you return to 
Photoshop, you're not modifying the original

04:09: DNG file, because that link is broken; now you're 
saving your changes back to the Photoshop composition.

04:16: So if you find that you want to modify that 
original California coast.dng file on disk,

04:21: then you're going to have to open it from 
Bridge and once again make your changes to

04:26: the Aquas, Blues, and Purples values.

04:28: All right, there is one 
more change I want to make.

04:30: I'll go ahead and click on this blue link at the 
bottom of the window that begins Adobe RGB (1998).

04:36: That brings up a dialog box of settings that will 
allow you to change how the image opens in Photoshop.

04:42: And notice this final one, Sharpen For, you 
can actually specify that you want to sharpen

04:47: for a certain output, such as Glossy Paper 
in my case, and I'm going to set the Amount

04:53: to High so we can see what happens.

04:55: Now, you're not going to see anything happen 
in Camera Raw, but you will see the Sharpen

04:59: details in Photoshop.

05:02: Also notice this checkbox right here, Open 
in Photoshop as Smart Objects, if you turn

05:06: that checkbox on, then the Open button 
permanently changes to an Open Object button, and when

05:12: you click on it, you open your RAW images 
in Photoshop as Smart Objects by default.

05:18: If you want to override that, then you'd press the 
Shift key to change back to the Open Image button.

05:23: So whether you select it is entirely up to you,
I am going to leave it off and click OK.

05:28: But before you click OK, you should note that 
Sharpen For becomes a saved setting and we'll

05:33: see that in just a moment.

05:34: All right, I'll click OK and then click 
OK again in order to return to Photoshop.

05:41: And now notice if I zoom in on the image, 
I can see those sharpened details like so.

05:45: All right, I'm going to zoom back out, my sea is 
not nearly so blotchy, so that's a good thing.

05:51: Now, at this point you'd go ahead and save 
your image as a PSD document, because after

05:55: all it contains a layer in 
the form of a Smart Object.

05:59: I'm going to go ahead and return to Bridge 
for just a moment here by going to the File

06:03: menu and choosing Browse in Bridge.

06:05: And then I'll select that California coast.
dng file, then I'll press Ctrl+R or Cmd+R

06:10: in the Mac to revisit Camera Raw.

06:13: There is our blotchy sea, just like we 
left it, because this file didn't get fixed.

06:17: So let's go ahead and take care of the 
problem by changing those values once again;

06:22: -40, -70, and -40 for Aquas, Blues,
and Purples respectively.

06:27: Then what you want to do is click on that 
Blue link again and make sure to set Sharpen

06:32: For back to None, assuming of course that 
you don't want to sharpen future images.

06:37: Then I'll click OK and then I'll click Done.

06:40: And that's how you open an image from Camera 
Raw as a Smart Object so that you can edit

06:45: your Camera Raw settings anytime you like.


 ** Editing Camera Raw images from Bridge

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you three special things that 
you can do with Camera Raw images here in Bridge.

00:06: So for starters here, I'll select 
this file Spanishtown dinosaurs.

00:10: If I were to press Ctrl+R or Cmd+R, 
I would open Camera Raw hosted by Bridge.

00:15: If I were to double-click on the file, 
I'd open Camera Raw hosted by Photoshop.

00:20: Let's say you always want 
Bridge to host Camera Raw.

00:24: Well then, what you do is you press Ctrl+K 
or Command+K on the Mac in order to bring

00:29: up the Preferences dialog box and you want to 
switch to the General panel, if it doesn't

00:33: come up in general automatically and select 
Double-Click Edits Camera Raw Settings in

00:39: Bridge and then click OK.

00:41: And now if I double-click on this thumbnail, 
it opens in Camera Raw inside the Bridge,

00:46: just as if you have pressed 
Ctrl+R or Cmd+R. All right.

00:49: I am going to cancel out of here.

00:51: Now contrast that by the way to pressing 
Ctrl+O or Cmd+O on the Mac, that's going to go

00:56: ahead and switch you to Photoshop as 
always and Photoshop, will host Camera Raw.

01:01: Once again I am going to cancel out here and 
I'll go up to the File menu and choose Browse

01:05: in Bridge or press Ctrl+Alt+O, Cmd+Opt+O
on the Mac to switch back to Bridge.

01:10: So, that was special item number one,
here is special item number two.

01:14: Let's say you want to open an image in 
Photoshop, but you want to bypass Camera Raw.

01:18: You just want to accept the 
settings you have and start working.

01:21: Well, in that case, you press the Shift 
key and double-click on the thumbnail.

01:26: Even though we've set double-clicking to open 
the image in Camera Raw in Bridge, by virtue

01:31: of the fact that I had the Shift key down, 
it still goes ahead and switches those to

01:34: Photoshop and opens the 
file directly. All right.

01:38: Let's return to the Bridge once more and now 
I'll show you special thing number three which

01:42: is how you can copy and paste Camera 
Raw settings between different images.

01:47: I am going to start off by right-clicking on 
Spanishtown dinosaurs.dng, choosing Develop

01:52: Settings from the list, and 
then you choose Copy Settings.

01:56: Then switch over to Swim meet-1.dng which 
is right next door and I'm feeling pretty

02:01: good about replacing these settings because 
I have already got him backed up on the other

02:05: three Swim meet files.

02:07: So I'll right-click on the image, choose 
Develop Settings and then choose Paste Settings.

02:12: Then you get that big long list of settings 
that you could possibly copy and paste and

02:18: by default only the last three which 
are local changes, are deselected.

02:23: I am going to go ahead and select Local Adjustments 
because I want to see what those Brush Adjustments

02:28: and Gradial Filters look 
like when applied to Sam here.

02:32: So having done that I'll go ahead and click 
OK and that will change the file like so,

02:36: and you can see that he now has the sort of 
dinosaur shapes painted on his face along

02:42: with the other settings.

02:44: Now you might expect him to look a lot like 
the dinosaur image, that is the blues would

02:48: be bright and the oranges would be shiny and 
that kind of stuff, but we are starting with

02:53: a totally different photograph that 
was shot under different circumstances.

02:56: So we are going to get very 
different results. All right.

02:59: That was a fairly absurd demonstration.

03:02: But there is a method to my madness here.

03:03: I am going to go up to California coast.dng 
and right-click on it and then choose Develop

03:08: Settings and choose Copy Settings, and now 
I'll scroll back down to Sam here and

03:13: I'll right-click on him and 
choose Develop Settings.

03:16: But before I can choose Paste Settings, I 
need to get rid of those Local Adjustments.

03:21: So any time you apply Local Adjustments this 
way, you need to clear them before you apply

03:26: different settings because 
otherwise they will stay there.

03:29: So I am going to choose Clear Settings, and 
incidentally, when you choose Clear Settings

03:33: you get rid of everything, you wipe out the 
Camera Raw settings, you wipe out the Crop

03:37: Settings, you wipe out the Local Adjustments, the 
only thing that stays intact is your snapshots,

03:43: they will remain. All right.

03:45: So I'll go ahead and choose Clear Settings.

03:47: That restores the original version of 
the file without the Local Adjustments.

03:51: Now I'll right-click in the thumbnail, choose 
Develop Settings again, and then choose Paste

03:56: Settings, up comes the dialog box, this time with 
those same settings in place, Local Adjustments

04:02: automatically turns itself off, I'll go ahead 
and click OK, and we end up with this final

04:07: version of the effect which is quite 
different than what we had before and makes Sam look

04:13: like he's gone back in time and 
gotten cast in a silent movie.

04:17: And those are three very special things that 
you can do with Camera Raw images from Bridge.


 ** Duotones

00:00: Back in Chapter 20 of the Intermediate course,
I showed you how to mix a full-color photo

00:05: to make a black-and-white one, which 
Photoshop calls grayscale, but here's the problem.

00:11: If you submit a grayscale image to a commercial print 
house, that photo will print to a single ink, black.

00:17: Why is that a problem?

00:19: A single ink offers at most a hundred levels of 
luminance and even that is wildly optimistic.

00:25: But here is the thing; none of 
those hundred levels is truly black.

00:29: I mean think about it.

00:30: Have you ever seen an ink that was so dark 
that it sucked all the light from a room and

00:34: rendered a page completely black?

00:37: At best, black ink by itself is darkish gray.

00:41: So how do you make those great super intense 
black-and-white photographs that you see in

00:46: high-end glossy magazines with the fashion 
ads and the fifth color fragrance rubs?

00:51: You use all the inks available to you, and this is 
very important, you always print to white paper.

00:58: That way black is supersaturated with a ton 
of ink and white is the brightest paper on

01:03: earth with no ink whatsoever.

01:06: Two inks that print in concert to make a black-and-
white photo are called Duotones, three inks are

01:11: called a Tritone, four inks are called a 
Quadtone, but in the end they are all ways of super

01:17: saturating a monochrome image with 
color, as we'll explore in this chapter.


 ** Creating a professional-quality sepia tone

00:00: In this movie I'll demonstrate what has to be 
the simplest way to create a solid, professional-

00:06: quality sepia tone in Photoshop. And so we'll 
be taking this black and white treatment and

00:10: converting it into this powerful sepia 
tone here, so let's see how it works.

00:15: For starters I have got this full-color photograph, 
I'll go ahead and Alt+Click on the eye in

00:19: front of close couple, and I've added 
a couple of Adjustment layers here.

00:23: The first is this Channel Mixer layer.

00:25: And while a Channel Mixer is an old-school 
approach, I have to say it might be my favorite

00:29: way for distilling black and white photographs.

00:32: So obviously I turned on the Monochrome checkbox,
we've got 60% Red, subtracting 30% Green and

00:38: then adding 76% Blue, it's a total of 106 
with a Constant set to -1% and that ends up

00:45: filling out the histogram.

00:47: On top of that I've got this Curves Adjustment 
layer here, and you can see that we are just

00:51: adding a little bit of highlight contrast.

00:53: All right, so the next step with that 
Contrast layer selected is to press the Alt key

00:59: or the Option key on a Mac and then click the 
black/white icon at the bottom of the Layers

01:02: panel and choose Solid Color, and then I'll go 
ahead and call this layer sepia, and click OK.

01:08: That will bring up the Color Picker dialog box 
and it'll show the foreground color by default.

01:13: I'm going to go ahead and set the Hue value 
to 30 degrees or raise the Saturation to 45%

01:18: and I'll take the Brightness value 
pretty high to 80% and then I'll click OK.

01:23: So now the thing is you can dial in any color 
you want, that's just the suggested color.

01:29: Then I'm going to set the Blend mode in the 
upper left corner of Layers panel, from Normal

01:33: to Multiply in order to burn those colors in.

01:37: Now I really only want to bring the colors 
into the shadow details, I want to leave the

01:41: highlights neutral.

01:42: So I need to add Density Mask, so I'll Alt+
Click or Opt+Click on the eye in front of the

01:48: close couple layer, and then I'll go over 
to the Channels panel and you can see that

01:52: we've got the Red Channel here, which affords 
us the most contrast, because the couple's

01:56: faces are very bright.

01:57: Then in the Green Channel the skin tones start 
to darken and then in the Blue Channel they

02:02: get darker still.

02:03: So, we want the channel with the 
most contrast; that's the Red Channel.

02:07: I'm going to Ctrl+Click or Cmd+Click on 
that channel in order to load it as a selection

02:12: outline, then I'll switch 
back to the RGB image.

02:15: Go back to the Layers panel, turn all the 
layers back on by Alt+Clicking or Opt+Clicking

02:20: on the eye in front of close couple, and 
then because we want a Density Mask as opposed

02:25: to Luminance Mask, so in other words, we want to 
mask away the highlights and keep the shadows.

02:30: You drop down to the Add Layer mask icon at the 
bottom of the Layers panel and you Alt+Click

02:35: or Opt+Click on it, and you end up getting this 
effect here, and that's pretty much most the work.

02:40: The other thing I want to do is elevate the 
contrast, because if you take a look at the

02:45: final version of the image, you can see that 
we've got some clarity; that is some darkening

02:49: that adds weight around the 
details inside this image.

02:52: So, I'll switch back to the image in progress 
here and I will press the Ctrl key or the

02:57: Command key on the Mac and click on that layer 
mask in order to load it up, then I'll click

03:03: on the close couple layer to make it active 
and I'll convert it to a Smart Object by going

03:07: up to the Layers panel flyout menu and choosing 
Convert to Smart Object or if you loaded dekeKeys,

03:12: you can press Ctrl+,(comma) or Cmd+,(comma) 
on the Mac and then you want to go up to the

03:17: Filter menu and choose Other and then choose 
High Pass, or again, if you loaded dekeKeys,

03:22: you can press Shift+F10.

03:24: Inside the High Pass dialog box I want you to 
enter Radius of 12 pixels, where this image

03:28: is concerned; this is a 
moderate to low resolution image.

03:32: If you're working in a higher resolution, you 
would need to experiment with higher Radius

03:37: values, probably at least twice 
the size, and then click OK.

03:42: And finally, we want to change the Blend mode, 
because you can see that we're losing contrast so far.

03:47: So I'll double-click on that little slider 
icon to the right of the words High Pass and

03:51: I'll switch the mode from Normal to Overlay 
and we end up achieving this effect here,

03:56: and that is all there is to it.

03:58: If I press the F12 key, you can see that we 
started with a black and white photograph

04:02: and then just a few minutes later if I press 
Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on a Mac, you can see

04:07: that we end up with a professional-quality 
sepia tone with all kinds of lustrous detail

04:13: and high impact contrast,
here inside Photoshop.


 ** Introducing the Gradient Map adjustment

00:00: In this movie I'll introduce you to Gradient Map, 
which allows you to infuse your black and white

00:05: image with as many colors as you like.

00:08: Now I'm looking at a variation on that black and 
white effect that uses a black and white adjustment

00:12: layer as opposed to a channel mixer layer.

00:16: And the reason is, I want you to see the 
difference between just going with something like

00:20: Tint and creating a full on duotone.

00:22: So, I'll turn on the Tint checkbox and in 
order to get the same effect as we were seeing

00:28: a moment ago, or something similar anyway, 
I'll click on that Color Swatch to bring up

00:32: the Color Picker dialog box and I'll change 
the Hue value to 30, I'll take the Saturation

00:37: value down to 15 and I'll set the 
Brightness to 30% and I'll click OK.

00:42: Certainly that's an easy way to work 
and we now have a tinted photograph.

00:46: However, if you go ahead and compare that 
to the true sepia tone that we saw in the

00:51: previous movie, you'll notice that 
it is a pretty different effect.

00:55: We have more neutral highlights going on inside 
the sepia tone, the colors are full on burned

01:00: into the shadows whereas where the tinted 
image is concerned we're just taking a low

01:04: saturation color, basically colorizing the 
entire image with it, it's the same as doing

01:10: this for example.

01:11: I'm going to double-click on the Black & 
White layers thumbnail in order to bring up the

01:15: Properties panel, and I'm going to turn-off 
the Tint checkbox for a moment, and then

01:20: I'll hide the panel, and press the Alt key or the 
Option key on the Mac, click the Black & White

01:24: icon at the bottom of the panel, choose Solid 
Color, we'll go ahead and call this guy sepia

01:28: once again and I'll go ahead and dial-in 
those same color values 30, 15, and 30, and then

01:35: we'll set the Blend mode from Normal to Color, and 
I'm just doing this by way of demonstration here.

01:40: We are now seeing the same effect as we 
achieved using that Tint checkbox associated with the

01:46: Black & White layer, so if I double-click on 
the thumbnail for the Black & White layer

01:49: once again and turn this checkbox on, we 
don't see any difference on screen and then turn

01:54: this layer off, it's the exact same thing, so 
you're just infusing the entire image with a color.

02:01: We can do better than that using either that 
sepia tone technique that I showed you in

02:05: a previous movie which is quite straightforward or, 
with little more work, we can apply Gradient Map.

02:11: So, I'm going to go ahead and turn that Tint 
checkbox off, we don't need it, and it'll

02:15: just get in our way and then I'll click on 
the contrast layer at the top of the stack

02:19: here and I'll press the Alt key or the Option 
key on the Mac, click the Black & White icon

02:23: once again at the bottom of the Layers panel and 
choose the second command up, Gradient Map.

02:28: And I'll go ahead and name this guy colorize, 
because that's what we're going to do, even

02:32: though instead of colorizing using a single 
color will infuse the image with multiple

02:37: colors then I'll click OK.

02:39: Now what we're seeing here is a Gradient strip 
inside the Properties panel, going from black

02:44: to white, and what Gradient Map does is it 
goes ahead and replaces the luminance levels

02:49: inside the image with that gradient.

02:52: So it starts with black on the left-hand side 
and ends with white under right-hand side,

02:56: so in another words we're replacing the black and white 
image with the colors found in the black to white gradient.

03:02: So that means we're not going to 
see much difference at this point.

03:05: I'll go ahead and turn the layer off for a 
second and then turn it back on, it's just

03:09: increasing the contrast of the image, and 
that's because of the Gaussian distribution

03:14: of the colors inside that gradient.

03:16: So the colors ramp slowly in the dark areas I 
think quickly in the middle and then slowly

03:20: again and the highlights, which squeezes the 
luminance range inside the image again thereby

03:25: increasing the contrast.

03:27: You can switch to a different gradient. Now 
there aren't a lot of gradients that are included

03:31: along with Photoshop by default, you do have 
some other gradients that ship with the program

03:36: and you can get to them by clicking on that 
little gear icon and then choosing any one

03:40: of these gradient libraries and then experimenting 
with them, but none of them are really truly

03:44: designed to serve as duotones for a photograph.

03:48: Probably the closest one would be something 
like copper and when I first select Copper

03:52: you'll think I'm insane, it goes ahead and 
replaces the blacks with this light brown,

03:56: so starting on the left that's where black is,
and then we get into the dark gray region

04:01: and we get some very light browns and then 
we go back into the highlights here and we

04:05: get some very dark browns and then we end 
with some light browns for white, but we can

04:10: change how the colors are mapping, and you 
know, I'm a go ahead and decrease the height

04:15: of this Properties panel, so 
we can see the model's eye.

04:18: We can merge this gradient better into the 
image if we go ahead and change the Blend mode.

04:22: So I'm going to click on Normal in the upper 
left corner of the Layers panel and change

04:26: that Blend mode from Normal to Color, and 
then it'll go ahead and infuse the image with

04:31: that color, and then if I want, I could 
reduce the opacity of the layer as will.

04:35: For example I'll press 2 to reduce the 
Opacity to 20% and we end up with a halfway decent

04:40: duotone, let's go ahead and compare that to 
the sepia tone that we created in the previous

04:45: movie here it is, so it's pretty different, 
it's yellower effect than what we're using

04:48: right now, and then when I switch back you 
can see that we have something of an orange

04:53: or reddish effect.

04:55: But the truth of the matter is that we're 
blending very subtle color variations throughout

04:59: the shadows, midtones, and 
highlights inside this image.

05:03: If you want to see a more radical color variation 
double-click on the thumbnail for that Gradient

05:07: Map layer once again the one that's called 
colorize, and I'll switch it to something

05:12: like Violet, Orange, for example, and then 
I'll hide the Properties panel again and

05:16: I'll press the 3 key to bring 
the Opacity up to 30%.

05:20: And now you can see that we've managed to 
infuse the shadows with violet, we've got

05:25: oranges and the midtones and 
the highlights and so forth.

05:28: So that's how you use a Gradient Map adjustment to infuse 
a black and white image with a rich array of colors.

05:34: However, we can do better by loading some 
custom gradients that I've created for you

05:39: and I'll show you how that 
works in the next movie.


 ** Loading a library of custom gradients

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to load a 
library of gradients that I've created for

00:04: you in advance that are specially designed 
to work with the Gradient Map adjustment in

00:08: order to create custom duotones.

00:10: So I'm going to start things off by changing 
the Blend mode back to Normal and then I'll

00:15: press the Escape key and press the 0 key 
in order to reinstate an Opacity of 100%.

00:21: Next if you're working along with me.

00:22: Go ahead and double-click on the thumbnail 
for the colorized layer to bring up Gradient

00:26: Map inside the Properties panel, and then 
click the down-pointing arrowhead next door

00:30: to the Gradient Bar.

00:31: If you click in the bar you're going to bring 
up the Gradient Editor dialog box, in which

00:35: case just cancel out.

00:37: And then click on that little gear 
icon and choose Load Gradients.

00:41: Then navigate your way to the 28_duotones 
folder inside the exercise files folder.

00:46: Find a file called dekeTones16 that contains 
16 different duotone-ready gradients.

00:52: Then click the Load button in order to load them 
on up, and they start with this guy right here.

00:57: What I'll do is I'll just kind of tour you through 
them here so you can get a sense of what they do.

01:02: There is this Warm palette gradient, that's 
going to create a pretty bright reddish duotone.

01:06: And then we've got a blue variation on that 
as well as yellow called Sepia palette and

01:11: that ends up giving us pretty good sepia tone 
effect. But bear in mind these gradients were

01:15: necessarily designed for this specific image 
rather what I was trying to do is, create

01:20: a group of gradients that will work with a 
wide variety of images, but you may have to

01:24: modify them to some extent or other to suit 
your particular needs, and I'll show you how

01:29: that works in the next movie.

01:30: Now we have some reversing gradients that 
start bright and then end up darkening up.

01:36: So in other words the shadows, especially 
the blacks end up changing to a color,

01:40: in this case green, and then we go in the case 
of this Gradient to a dark brown and then

01:45: things lighten up incrementally with 
little bit of darkening in the highlights.

01:49: And you can tour your way 
through these as well.

01:51: Each one of them sort of reverses back or have 
some sort of luminance variation built into it.

01:58: Next we've got this guy X-ray invert, which 
is an unusual one, in that it inverts the

02:02: image as it turns green.

02:04: But you can change its behavior if you want 
to by turning on this Reverse checkbox,

02:08: in which case, it's going to produce more 
or less a straightforward green effect.

02:12: And you can try out Reverse along with some of 
these other gradients as well, these gradients

02:16: that double-back on themselves.

02:18: All right, I'll go head and 
turn the Reverse checkbox off.

02:22: Next we have some colorful 
complementary gradients.

02:25: So this one goes from violet to yellow, 
then we go from red to cyan here.

02:29: This one goes from blue or orange, and 
we've got this earth and sky gradient.

02:34: These last three gradients here are probably the 
ones that work best with this particular image.

02:39: We've got Broad Sienna and it's probably worth 
comparing this effect to the sepia tone that

02:44: we created in the first movie.

02:46: And you can see well the sepia tone is very 
understated where the colors are concerned,

02:51: this one has colors that pop.

02:53: So again completely up to you 
if this is the effect you want.

02:56: If you want to back it off all you 
have to do is reduce the Opacity value.

03:00: For example I can press the 5 
key to set the Opacity to 50%.

03:04: All right, I want to show you the last two.

03:06: So I'll go ahead and press 0 for an Opacity 
of a 100%, double-click on the thumbnail for

03:11: the colorized layer.

03:12: Click the down-pointing arrowhead and then 
choose this guy right there Plate finish,

03:16: which ends up creating an exceptional sepia 
effect where this particular image is concerned.

03:22: It's very similar to the one that 
we created in the first movie.

03:25: The big difference is, we're able to 
bring this bluish gray into the highlights.

03:28: And then finally at the very end of the list 
we've got blue metallic which produces this

03:33: bluish duotone here.

03:35: So that just gives you an idea of the variety 
of different duotones you can create just

03:40: by clicking through a 
library of predefined gradients.

03:43: In the next movie I'll show you how to 
design a custom gradient of your own.


 ** Creating a custom quadtone

00:00: In this movie we'll design a custom gradient 
to turn this low color image, without even

00:04: converting it to black and white, 
into this duotone right here.

00:09: Although technically speaking it's a quad-tone 
because it contains four distinct colors.

00:14: So I'll go ahead and switch back to our starter 
image here and I'll press the Alt key or the

00:18: Option key on the Mac, click the Black/White 
icon at the bottom of the panel and choose

00:22: Gradient Map, and I'll call this 
layer quadtone and then I'll click OK.

00:27: Now we'll start things off, if you're working along 
with me and you have access to the exercise files,

00:32: with this guy called Complementary VY.

00:35: Now if you don't have the exercise files, 
that's totally okay, I'll be showing you how

00:39: to create the final gradient for yourself, 
this is just a good point to start at,

00:43: and then I'll press the Enter key or the Return 
key on the Mac to hide that list of gradients,

00:47: and I'll click inside the Gradient Bar to 
bring up the Gradient Editor dialog box.

00:52: Now I'd like you to treat these little color 
stops in the gradient as if they are points

00:56: along the bottom of a Histogram, like we're 
working in Levels dialog box, so we've got

01:01: black over here on the left and 
we've got white over here under right.

01:05: We are currently mapping black which is at 
a Location of 0%, too black, so our shadows

01:10: are remaining black inside the image.

01:12: And then at the 100% position which you should 
think of is being a 100% white we have white

01:18: and then all the other colors 
or luminance levels in between.

01:21: So we're going to start things off by 
changing these colors around, I don't want them to

01:25: be this highly-saturated, so I'm going to 
double-click on the first yellow color stop

01:30: in order to bring it up, and I'm going to 
reduce the Saturation value by pressing

01:35: Shift+Down Arrow and then Down Arrow a few 
times to get it down to 25%.

01:40: Otherwise these color values are fine, a 
Hue of 50 degrees and a Brightness of 85%.

01:45: Now I'll go ahead and click OK and you can see 
that that goes ahead and reduces the saturation

01:50: inside the highlights in this image.

01:53: Now I'll double-click on the orange color 
stop and I'm not going to take it down quite

01:57: as much, I'm just going to take it down to 
45%, a Hue of 35 degrees is just fine, and

02:02: I'll take the Brightness value 
down to 70% as well, then click OK.

02:08: Next I'm going to double-click on this very 
dark blue Color Swatch to bring it up and

02:12: I'm going to modify the Hue value slightly, 
I'll take it up to 220, then I'll take the

02:16: Saturation value down to 25% and I'll raise 
the Brightness value to 55%, which is going

02:23: to seem strange at first, but we're going to 
move this color stop to another location,

02:27: so I'll click OK and notice now if I want 
a darken things up I'll go ahead and move

02:33: the Color Stop over to the right.

02:35: So typically when you're working with 
progressively lighter color stops like these if you move

02:40: the stop to the left, you're going to brighten 
the image, if you move it to the right you're

02:44: going to darken the image.

02:46: What you're really trying to do is map this 
color to a specific group of luminance levels

02:51: inside the image and at about 45% 
I get the effect I'm looking for.

02:55: Now I'm going to have to move the other Color 
Stops in just a moment, but this is good for now.

02:58: And then I'll click on this dark violet 
Color Stop that has a location of 10%, double-click

03:04: on it to bring up the Color Picker dialog 
box, I'm going to take the Saturation way

03:08: down to 15%, and I'm also going to take the 
Brightness value down to 15% as well,

03:15: and then I'll click OK in 
order to accept that change.

03:18: So we've got black, we've got a very dark 
purple, mapping the darkest luminance levels

03:23: inside the image.

03:25: We've got the sort of washed out blue here 
that's mapping these midtones, and then we've

03:30: got these two guys that aren't quite set to 
the right locations, so I'm going to click

03:34: on this orange Color Stop that's had a location 
of 75% and to brighten the colors up a little bit,

03:40: I'm going to press Shift+Down Arrow in 
order to reduce that location value to 65%.

03:46: And then I'll click on that final Color Stop, 
the pale yellow one, and I'll take its Location

03:51: value down to 80%.

03:53: Now what I recommend you do at this point 
is you go ahead and name your gradient and

03:57: save it in case you want to use it later. 
And you do that in a strange way, you don't

04:01: click the Save button.

04:03: Rather you first name the gradient, so you 
have to give it a name first, and I'm going

04:07: to call mine Denim & bone, after the colors 
that I'm seeing here inside this image,

04:12: and then you click on the New button and that 
goes ahead and adds that gradient to the list

04:17: and it's important that you name 
the gradient and then click New.

04:20: If you just click New, you're 
going to create a new unnamed swatch.

04:23: All right, now click OK in 
order to accept that change.

04:27: All right, now let's say just for the sake 
of demonstration that this is the fifth or

04:32: sixth such gradient that you've created and 
you're starting to feel like you want to backup

04:36: your gradients, so that you don't lose them,
which is a really great idea by the way.

04:41: Then what you do is go to the Edit menu and 
you choose Presets and then you choose Preset

04:46: Manager and you can see if you loaded dekeKeys 
I've given you a shortcut of Ctrl+Shift+P

04:51: or Cmd+Shift+P on the Mac.

04:53: Then switch Preset Type from Brushes to Gradients 
and you'll see a list of all the gradients

04:57: that are presently loaded, let's say you want 
to go ahead and backup the one you just made

05:02: of course as well as these three right here, 
then you go ahead and click on one Shift+Click

05:08: on the other to select an entire range. If 
you want to select nonadjacent gradients then

05:13: you Ctrl+Click on them on the PC or 
Cmd+Click on them on the Mac.

05:18: Then go ahead and click on the Save Set button 
and then give your gradients a name such as

05:23: I'll go ahead and call mine My custom grads, 
and I think I've got a little problem there,

05:28: so I'll hit Forward Delete key and click on 
the Save button and you've saved out those

05:32: specifically selected gradients, then 
click on Done and you are backed up.

05:38: And that's how you go about creating a custom 
gradient for the purpose of creating a duotone,

05:42: a tritone, a quadtone or what 
have you here inside Photoshop.


 ** Colorizing with blend modes and Opacity

00:00: Now creating a custom gradient is all very 
well and good, but if that was the only option,

00:04: it would mean you'd have to customize even 
the best of gradients on an image by image

00:09: basis, because the luminance levels 
in every single image are different.

00:14: But if instead, you just like to take your 
collection of gradients and shoehorn them

00:18: to fit an image, just make them fit. Well 
in that case, the solution is to adjust the

00:23: Blend Modes and Opacity Settings.

00:26: And here's what that looks like.

00:27: I'll start things off by double-clicking on 
the thumbnail for this Quadtone layer, and

00:32: then I'll click the down pointing arrow head, 
and I'll just grab one of my preset gradients,

00:36: such as Green repeat, and you can see how 
it ends up creating these sort of ghostly

00:40: areas of green inside of 
the darkest of the shadows.

00:44: That's probably not the effect we're looking 
for right off the bat, because it ends up

00:48: with lot of posterization inside the image.

00:51: So I'll hide the Properties panel.

00:53: To make any gradient work, if you just want 
to map it to the existing luminance levels

00:57: inside the image, you can choose Color, and 
that will take care of the problem immediately.

01:02: So you're just taking all of the colors inside of 
that gradient and mapping them to the luminance

01:07: levels inside the image.

01:10: Another way to work that may turn out to 
deliver more exciting results is to switch to one

01:15: of the first two contrast modes, 
either Overlay or Soft Light.

01:19: I'll start with Overlay here, and you can 
see that that's a little bit over the top,

01:23: but we do get an amazing high contrast effect.

01:27: I'll go ahead and press the Escape key so 
that the blend mode is no longer active.

01:31: If it goes too far, for example, in our case 
we're over darkening the shadows and over

01:35: brightening the highlights, because overlay 
and the other contrast modes tend to increase

01:39: the contrast of the image.

01:42: Then go ahead and press something like the 
5 key to reduce the opacity to 50% and we

01:47: get this effect here, which is pretty great, but I 
also urge you to try out the Soft Light mode.

01:53: So, I'll increase the opacity to 100% and 
switch the mode from Overlay to the next mode

01:58: down, Soft Light, and then I'll again press 
the Escape key, so the blend mode is no longer

02:03: active here on the PC, and we end up with 
this really awesome effect in my opinion.

02:10: I'm just going to take the Opacity down a 
little bit by pressing the 7 key for 70%.

02:15: All right, so that's how things fare in a 
low color image that we didn't even bother

02:20: to convert to black and white in first place.

02:22: What if we start with a black-and-white image?

02:24: I'll go ahead and switch over to our couple 
again, double-click on the thumbnails for

02:28: its Gradient Map Adjustment layer, and then 
this time I'll change to gradient to another

02:33: one of my presets, which is Blue repeat.

02:36: And we get this effect here where once again 
the shadows are leaping forward and becoming

02:41: bright, because of that range of 
moderately bright colors inside the gradient.

02:45: So I'll press the Enter key in order to hide 
those gradients and then I'll close the Properties

02:49: panel and I'll experiment with a Blend Modes 
once again. You can try out Overlay if you

02:53: want to, that's going to produce pretty 
harsh effect in the case of this image.

02:57: So I'm going to switch forward, and by the way,
give you a little keyboard shortcut here.

03:02: If I press the Escape key so the blend mode 
is not longer active, again, you only have

03:05: to do that on the PC,

03:06: I can advance to the next Blend mode, whether 
I'm on a Mac or the PC by pressing Shift+Plus (+)

03:11: and that will take me from 
Overlay to Soft Light in this case.

03:16: If I press Shift+Minus (-) it would take me 
the other direction from Soft Light to Overlay.

03:20: Anyway, I want the Soft Light mode, so I'll 
go ahead and select it, and then I'll press

03:25: the 3 key to reduce the opacity to 
30% and we get this effect here.

03:30: So, just for the sake of comparison, if I turn 
the layer off, this is the no color grayscale

03:36: image, and then if I turn layer back on, this is that 
same image infused with just a little bit of color.

03:42: Now I'll press the F key in order to fill the 
screen with the image and zoom on in as well.

03:47: And so this is that colorized version of the 
black and white image of the couple and then

03:52: this is the hand tinted version really, of 
the low color landscape image, both created

03:58: using Gradient Map along with the Soft Light 
mode and some reduced opacity levels,

04:04: here inside Photoshop.


 ** Creating a faux-color, high-key effect

00:00: In this movie, we're going to take this 
portrait shot from the Fotolia image library,

00:04: about which you can learn more at fotolia.com/deke.

00:06: And we're going to assign it a kind of faux 
color treatment and add a high key effect

00:11: as well in order to create 
this variation on the image.

00:15: And notice that her hair and sweater as well 
as her pupils and eyelashes are jet black,

00:20: meanwhile her face and neck are very light, 
but none of the highlights are blown, in other

00:25: words we don't have any flat 
areas of white inside the image.

00:28: Now, strictly speaking this is not a duotone 
and yet we have achieved an image that has

00:33: a high degree of color homogeneity.

00:36: So I am going to switch back to the base 
image here and I am going to start things off by

00:40: pressing the Alt key or the Option key on 
the Mac, then click on the Black/White icon

00:44: and choose the Black & White command and 
I'll call this new layer B&W and click OK.

00:49: And now I'm going to dial in some values.

00:51: Now I want her face to be very bright, I 
might as well drag it over a little bit here

00:55: so we can see what we're doing.

00:57: And because we all, regardless of skin luminance, 
we are all orange people, we're going to resonate

01:02: the most in the reds and the yellows.

01:05: So I am going to crank that Reds value up 
to a 130 and I'll take the Yellows value up

01:09: to a 100 and that takes care of most of 
our work where the skin is concerned.

01:14: Now I am not really seeing any Greens inside 
the image, so when you don't really see a

01:18: color at all you can just zero it out or in 
my case just to see if there are any I'll

01:23: go ahead and take that value through the roof here 
to 300, don't look like it makes any difference.

01:29: So I'll tab on to Cyans value and take that 
value down a little bit and then tab over

01:34: to Blues and take that value up to 300 
so that we brighten the background.

01:40: And then finally I want her sweater which is 
purple to go black, so I am going to take

01:45: the Magentas value down to its 
lowest -200 and that's it. All right.

01:49: Now I'll hide the Properties panel.

01:51: Now the next step is to dodge and burn what 
we've created so far, and that means that

01:56: we have to merge our work onto a new layer.

02:00: And anytime you want to merge all the visible 
layers onto a new one, you have to press the

02:04: keyboard shortcut that's based on a 
shortcut that you can see in the layers menu.

02:08: You'll notice this command called Merge Visible 
that has a keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+Shift+E

02:13: or Cmd+Shift+E.

02:14: If you choose that command you'll go 
ahead and merge those two images together.

02:18: That's not what we want, so I'll 
press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on the Mac.

02:21: Instead what we want is to add the Alt key 
on the PC or the Option key on the Mac to

02:26: that same shortcut.

02:27: So that would be Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E or Cmd+Shift+Opt+E 
on the Mac, and that goes ahead and merges

02:33: those two layers onto a new one, and I'll 
call this new layer D&B like so. All right.

02:39: Now I'll go ahead and grab the Dodge tool 
and I'm assuming that your settings are their

02:43: defaults which are a Range of 
Midtones and an Exposure of 50%.

02:48: If that's the case then you can go ahead and 
brush in on the highlights inside of the image.

02:53: So I am not just brushing indiscriminately 
all over the face, I am trying to limit my

02:57: modifications to some of the lightest details.

03:01: Because if you go nuts and just start 
brushing all over the place, which I am not, by the

03:05: way, I am not trying to demonstrate that I am,
if you start doing that though, then you

03:09: will flatten the face details considerably.

03:11: And we want to keep the volumetric detail; we just 
want to make sure to brighten things up a lot.

03:17: And we'll fix some of those 
details using the Burn tool.

03:19: In fact, we might as well select the tool now.

03:21: Go ahead and click and hold on the 
Dodge tool and then choose the Burn tool.

03:25: And by the way, at the risk of overwhelming 
you with tricks at this point, I should point

03:29: out that you can switch from one tool 
to another by adding the Shift key.

03:34: So if I press Shift+O, I would switch 
from the Dodge tool to the Burn tool.

03:38: Another way to do it is to Alt+Click or Opt+Click 
in the current occupant of that slot, so if

03:44: I Alt+Click or Option+Click on the Dodge tool 
it will take me to the Burn tool. All right.

03:48: So I am going to burn some of these shadows 
along the outside edges of her face like so

03:55: in order to reinstate some of that volumetric 
detail, so her face still looks nice and rounded.

04:01: And I might actually paint a 
second time over this region here.

04:04: Then we want to darken up the hair and sweater 
and those are very dark details already,

04:08: but I want to fill them in.

04:10: So I am going to change my 
Range from Midtones to Shadows.

04:12: I am going to leave the Exposures set to 50% 
and then I'll start painting in her hair and

04:17: you can see that that hair 
is just going jet black now.

04:21: If you need to apply a couple of 
passes of the tool, by all means do.

04:24: You can paint many times over 
these areas if you need to.

04:27: Don't paint into her face though; try to keep 
your modifications in the hair and sweater.

04:34: And I'm painting all this stuff to black as 
you can see and then I am just going to make

04:37: sure that the sweater is 
nice and black as well.

04:39: All right, that looks pretty darn good.

04:41: Now we need to bring back in the color, so I 
am going to press the M key to switch back

04:45: to the Rectangular Marquee tool, I'll click 
on the Background layer to make it active

04:49: and I'll press Ctrl+Alt+J or Cmd+Option+J 
on the Mac in order to jump this layer and

04:55: name it and I'll call the 
copy of the layer color.

04:58: And then I'll grab that layer and drag it 
to the top of the stack and I will change

05:03: it from Normal to the Color Blend mode, 
and we end up achieving this effect here.

05:08: Now the only area where this is a problem is in 
the blue around the outskirts of the hair.

05:13: So I'm going to press Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0 
on the Mac to go ahead and Zoom out.

05:18: I'll press the L key to switch to the Lasso 
tool, and then I'll press and hold the Alt

05:23: key or the Option key on the Mac.

05:25: Keep that key down as you click around the 
face like so and through this area of hair

05:30: and down into this region.

05:33: And then you want to dropdown to the Add Layer 
Mask icon and click on it, and that will go

05:37: ahead and mask the color into 
that face region. All right.

05:40: Now we need to create the 
gradient for the background.

05:43: So press the Ctrl key or the Command key on 
the Mac and click on that layer mask that

05:47: you just created a moment ago.

05:49: And then I want you to go up to the Select menu 
and choose Inverse or you can press Ctrl+Shift+I,

05:53: Cmd+Shift+I on the Mac in order 
to select the area outside her face.

05:57: I am going to press Ctrl+Shift+N or Cmd+Shift+N 
on the Mac to create a New layer and I'll

06:03: call it gradient and click OK.

06:07: I'll go ahead and select the Gradient tool 
which you can get by pressing the G key and

06:10: then I'll press the Alt key or the Option 
key on the Mac so I temporarily have that

06:14: eyedropper and I'll click somewhere inside the 
model's face in order to lift a skin tone color.

06:20: Then I'll go over to the Color panel 
and I'll slightly adjust my settings.

06:23: I am going to change the Hue value to 25, 
then I'll raise the Saturation value to 45%

06:29: and I'll take the Brightness 
down in my case to 75%.

06:33: Then armed with the Gradient tool I'll go 
ahead and drag from the top of the image about

06:36: midway down like so and release and that 
ends up covering everything up, fine.

06:42: I'll press the M key to switch back to the 
Rectangular Marquee tool, press Ctrl+D or

06:47: Cmd+D on the Mac to deselect the image 
and finally we want to change the Blend mode

06:51: in the upper left corner of Layers panel from 
Normal to Multiply, and that will go ahead

06:57: and burn that gradient into 
its background. All right.

07:00: Now I'll press the F key a couple of times 
to switch to the Full Screen mode and just

07:04: to give you a sense of what we've been able 
to achieve here, I'll press the F12 key, this

07:09: is the original version of the portrait shot,
and if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on the

07:13: Mac, this is the faux color high key effect, 
thanks to a bit of Black & White, Dodge and

07:19: Burn as well as the Color and 
Multiply modes here inside Photoshop.


 ** Noise vs. Details

00:00: This next chapter is about one of 
the worst things on earth, Noise.

00:05: If you've ever talked on a cell phone or 
looked up a map on a mobile device, or listened to

00:09: a car radio, or really done 
anything in a car, then you know noise.

00:13: It's the hiccup, it's the lurch, it's the 
adjectives that don't contribute to the message.

00:18: It's the extra sentences that 
I don't need to be saying now.

00:21: Simply put noise annoys.

00:24: In the world of digital photography, noise 
is the visual equivalent of static, random

00:29: fluctuations between neighboring pixels that don't 
accurately represent the scene as it was captured.

00:35: See this, this is smooth 
detail and this is noisy detail.

00:41: And as you open the ISO or push the depth of 
field or do anything fun and interesting,

00:46: the noise just gets bigger.

00:49: Fortunately Photoshop has ways to defeat noise,
and it does so by dividing noise into

00:54: two categories, Luminance and Color.

00:57: Luminance Noise is random 
variations in Brightness.

01:00: Color Noise is random 
variations in Hue and Saturation.

01:05: I start this chapter by showing 
you how to smooth away Noise.

01:08: Then I show you how to sharpen 
the details that are left over.

01:12: And then I show you how you can 
use noise to great special effects.

01:16: After all, noise isn't always bad.

01:19: Thanks to noise, we have grit, we 
have feeling, we have texture.

01:23: Let me show you how to master noise 
and you can use it anyway you want.


 ** Introducing the Reduce Noise filter

00:00: In this movie I'll introduce you to the 
Reduce Noise Filter, which is your primary means

00:04: for defeating noise in Photoshop.

00:06: Now, where digital photographs are concerned,
noise breaks down into two categories and

00:10: I've gone ahead and separated them here, even 
though they normally work together inside of a photo.

00:16: Up at the top we've got Luminance noise, which is random 
variations in the luminance of neighboring pixels;

00:21: and down at the bottom we have Color noise, 
which is random variations in the color values,

00:26: that is to say random variations in the luminance 
that varies from one color channel to the other.

00:33: And if I go ahead and zoom in here, 
you can see it even more closely.

00:37: So we've got Luminance noise at the top, 
separated from Color noise down here at the bottom.

00:41: All right, I'll go ahead and zoom back out.

00:44: I also want you to notice that the high 
contrast noise is collected here toward the center

00:49: of the image, whereas we have low contrast 
noise around the perimeter of the image.

00:54: Now, the reason that I've separated the 
Luminance noise and Color noise is because

00:58: Photoshop allows you to attack Luminance 
noise and Color noise independently.

01:02: So to show you how that works, I am going 
to turn off my two text layers and then

01:06: I am going to go ahead and merge the remaining 
layers onto a new layer by pressing Ctrl+Shift+E

01:11: or Cmd+Shift+E on the Mac.

01:13: Now we've got this new layer 1 that contains 
all of the photographic stuff and I'll go

01:17: ahead and rename it graduated noise like so.

01:20: And now, because I want to be able to edit 
my reduced noise values, I'll convert this

01:24: layer to a Smart Object by going up to the Layers 
panel flyout menu and choosing Convert to Smart Object.

01:29: Or if you loaded dekeKeys, you can press my 
shortcut of Ctrl+, or Cmd+, on the Mac.

01:34: Next, I want you to go up to the Filter menu, 
choose Noise, and choose the final command,

01:40: Reduce Noise, which I've given a shortcut of 
Shift+F9; again, if you've loaded dekeKeys.

01:45: Notice that we have a total of four numerical 
values over on the right side of the dialog box.

01:50: They include Strength, which 
attacks Luminance noise only.

01:54: Preserve Details serves as a counterbalance 
for Strength and it tries to bring back the

01:59: highest contrast edges, along with the 
highest contrast noise as we'll see.

02:04: Then we've got Reduce Color Noise, which affects the 
Color noise independently of the Luminance noise.

02:09: And finally, we have Sharpen Details, which goes ahead 
and sharpens up the highest contrast, luminance edges.

02:16: All right, let me show you 
what I mean by all that.

02:19: Let's focus first on the Luminance noise.

02:21: I am going to click on this little hard drive 
icon right there and I am going to create

02:25: a new settings called Luminance noise.

02:28: And then I'll press the Enter 
key, the Return key on the Mac.

02:30: Next, you need to go and switch over to 
that setting so you don't ruin your defaults.

02:35: And I'll go ahead and take Reduce Color Noise down to 
0 and then take Sharpen Details down to 0% as well.

02:41: Now, notice I can take Strength as low as 0, 
and as soon as I do, Preserve Details becomes

02:46: dimmed, because it no 
longer serves any purpose.

02:49: You have to have some Strength 
at work to use Preserve Details.

02:52: But because my image is so noisy, I am 
going to take this value all the way up to 10.

02:57: And you can see that it does almost nothing where 
the high contrast noise in the image is concerned.

03:04: That's because Preserve Details 
is set so very high by default.

03:07: Let's go ahead and take it 
down to 0 for starters here.

03:10: Then I'll zoom in on the Preview here inside the 
dialog box by clicking on the Plus (+)bu tton.

03:14: And notice, we've done a big number on the 
low contrast noise, around the perimeter of

03:19: the image; we're looking at the upper left 
corner currently, and we've also gotten rid

03:22: of a lot of the high contrast noise as well.

03:25: But in reducing that high contrast noise, 
we've also reduced the sharpness of the details

03:30: inside the photograph.

03:32: So you need to take this value up to some 
extent, and I'm actually nudging it up from

03:36: the keyboard by pressing the Up Arrow Key.

03:39: Notice where this image is concerned, even 
at a very low Preserve Details setting of 5%,

03:43: we are bringing back the high contrast noise 
as you can see here, along with the details.

03:49: And that's because of the way Photoshop interprets 
details, that is to say rapid luminance transitions

03:55: between neighboring pixels.

03:57: So I am going to go ahead and take this value 
up to 10%, and in doing so I bring back the

04:02: good stuff inside the image, but I also bring 
back the high contrast noise, whereas if I

04:07: scroll to the upper left-hand corner, you can see 
that the low contrast noise remains quelled.

04:12: All right, I'll go ahead and click the OK 
button in order to accept those settings.

04:16: So I've got a Strength of 10; 
Preserve Details of 10% as well.

04:19: All right, now just to reduce clutter inside 
the Layers panel, I am going to right-click

04:23: inside that Filter Mask and 
choose Delete Filter Mask.

04:26: If you loaded dekeKeys, you can also press 
Ctrl+Alt+Q or Cmd+Option+Q on a Mac.

04:31: Now let me show you how the 
Color noise option works.

04:33: I'll go ahead and press Ctrl+J or Cmd+J 
on the Mac to make a copy of that layer and

04:38: I'll turn it off.

04:39: Then for the bottom version here, let's just 
go ahead and rename graduated noise color

04:44: noise, so we can see there's a difference.

04:46: And I'll double-click on the words Reduce Noise 
in order to bring up the Reduce Noise panel.

04:49: And I'll save some new settings by 
clicking on that little hard drive icon.

04:53: Get rid of the word Copy, replace the 
word Luminance with Color, click OK.

04:58: And very important, I need to switch my 
Settings from Luminance noise to Color noise before

05:02: I change a single value.

05:03: Now I'll reduce the Strength value to 0.

05:06: That dims the Preserve Details value, 
so I don't have to worry about it.

05:09: And I'll take the Reduce 
Color Noise value up to 50%.

05:12: And I want you to see now the Luminance noise has not 
been modified at all, Photoshop leaves it alone.

05:19: Whereas, if I scroll down to the Color noise, 
you can see that it's pretty much altogether

05:22: defeated around the perimeter of the image, 
but it's still hanging on toward the center

05:27: of the image where we have 
the high contrast color noise.

05:30: So let's see what happens if I take it all 
the way up to 100%, then nearly all of the

05:35: Color noise goes away.

05:37: I'll click on the Plus (+) button so we can 
see here that we still have just a little

05:40: bit of Color noise; there is the original 
Color noise when I click and hold, and when

05:44: I release, almost all of it goes away, except the 
very high contrast noise inside of the model's face.

05:50: All right, now I'll click OK in 
order to apply those settings.

05:54: Now then, finally, I want to show 
you how the Sharpen option works.

05:57: I am going to turn the graduated noise layer 
back on and you can see that all the Color

06:00: noise goes back, because we hadn't 
reduced any of the Color noise on this layer.

06:05: And I'll switch to that layer and double-click 
on Reduce Noise in order to bring up the dialog

06:09: box, as well as the settings I had applied 
to that layer, with one exception, Settings

06:14: is changed back to Color noise; we need to 
switch it to Luminance noise just so we don't

06:18: wipe out our Color noise settings.

06:20: Pretty much a big pain in the neck, it's kind of a 
design flaw where this dialog box is concerned.

06:25: However, what I want you to notice is what 
happens if I go ahead and zoom in, let's say,

06:31: to the upper left region of the image where 
we've got the low noise, notice I'll increase

06:35: my Sharpen Details value to 50% and those 
upper right pixels are pretty much unaffected,

06:41: and that's because Sharpen Details focuses 
its attention on the high contrast edges.

06:46: So as soon as I start zooming in toward the 
central portion of the image, you can see

06:51: that the image itself is getting 
sharpened, but so is the high contrast noise.

06:56: Things get even worse if you 
start increasing this value further.

06:59: And notice, if you take Sharpen Details up 
to 100%, I'll go ahead and zoom out here,

07:04: this is just the worst possible sharpening 
algorithm you could hope for, which is why

07:10: I am going to tell you just flat out, leave 
this value set to 0%, there are much better

07:15: ways to sharpen high noise images, as I will be 
showing you over the course of this chapter.

07:21: So those are the basics of 
working with the Reduce Noise Filter.

07:24: I'll show you how to apply it to an 
actual digital photograph in the next movie.


 ** Correcting a noisy photo

00:00: Over the course of this project, we're going 
to take this macro photograph with this very

00:04: shallow depth of field so that some elements 
are in focus like this forward eye, and this

00:09: forward leg as well.

00:10: But many of the other elements are out of 
focus including this rear leg, portions of

00:14: the wings, and so forth.

00:16: And in part, as a result of that, 
we've got an awful lot of noise.

00:20: I will go ahead and zoom in to the image, 
and I'll scroll it over as well so that we

00:23: can see the copious amounts of noise; both 
color noise and luminance noise that are affecting

00:29: the low focus details as well as 
the shadows and the midtones.

00:34: We're going to defeat that noise, and ultimately 
sharpen the photograph as well using a

00:39: tried and true sharpening 
technique that actually works.

00:42: So you can see that we have all this wonderful 
detail popping inside this photograph,

00:46: and yet much of the noise, not quite all of 
it, but much of it is smoothed away.

00:49: And then finally, we'll add noise to 
the image in order to create an effect.

00:53: In this particular case, I will go ahead and 
zoom out here, you can see that we've rendered

00:57: the butterfly, so it looks almost as if it was 
painted onto watercolor paper or canvas. All right.

01:03: So I'll switch back to the original image.

01:05: We're going to start things off using Reduce 
Noise, and of course we want to be able to

01:09: modify it's settings, so I want to 
convert this layer to a Smart Object.

01:13: I'll start by double-clicking on a background 
item here in the Layers panel and I'll name

01:16: this layer butterfly, and then click OK.

01:19: And now, I'll go up to Layers panel flyout 
menu and choose Convert to Smart Object, or

01:23: press Ctrl+Comma or Cmd+Comma on the Mac.

01:26: Then you want to go up to the Filter menu, 
choose Noise, and then choose Reduce Noise,

01:31: or press Shift+F9.

01:33: We're seeing the last settings that I was 
playing around with, which are the Color Noise

01:37: settings, that is, I've cranked up this Reduce 
Color Noise value, but Strength is at 0, Sharpen

01:41: Details is at 0, and will be 
left there as well. All right.

01:45: So we'll start with the Reduce Color Noise 
value; 100% is probably a little bit too high.

01:50: So let's take it down to 0%, so that we can 
see all of the color noise inside of this image,

01:55: and there is a considerable amount.

01:58: Notice all the color variations at work 
in that upper portion of the rear leg.

02:02: We have a lot of color noise inside the 
eye and inside of the wing details as well.

02:07: So, what I recommend you do when you're trying 
to figure out what settings to apply, start

02:10: with everything zeroed out, and first, 
focus your attention on Reduce Color Noise.

02:15: Go ahead and select a value and then press 
Shift+Up-arrow a few times, and watch your

02:19: color noise go away.

02:20: You want to take this value as high as it 
needs to be to get rid of the color noise,

02:24: but you don't want to take it any higher.

02:25: For example, at about 70%, I'm seeing 
pretty much all of the color noise go away.

02:30: Right now, I'm clicking and holding;
we can see a ton of color noise.

02:33: As soon as I release to update the 
preview, that color noise is diminished.

02:38: I'll go ahead and scroll back up here.

02:39: Notice the upper portion of those legs, how 
much green, and blue, and purple noise we have.

02:44: And then if I release, 
that noise is mitigated.

02:47: So, color noise is easy to get rid of.

02:49: But you don't want to take the value too high, 
because if you do, the colors will start bleeding

02:53: out of the details.

02:54: So, as I say, 70% works well for this image.

02:57: Now, let's adjust the Strength Setting.

02:58: I'm going to press the Up Arrow key in 
order to raise that value in increments of 1.

03:03: And this image is so very noisy that I am going to 
want to take the Strength value all the way to 10.

03:09: And now if I click and hold inside the image, you can 
see this is the original version with all the noise.

03:14: And as soon as I release, that color and 
luminance noise is greatly diminished.

03:18: However, we're also losing a lot of 
details inside of the face for example.

03:24: It looks almost as if the face details have 
been melted which is why we need to take that

03:28: Preserve Details value up.

03:29: So, you want to start with it at 0 so we 
can gauge what Strength value to apply.

03:35: Then you just want to take that value up 
incrementally by pressing the Up Arrow key.

03:39: That's what generally 
works out the best for me.

03:41: I rarely find any use for big values such as 
50%, and larger, because that just brings

03:46: the biggest noise, the stuff that's 
the most obvious inside the image back.

03:50: So where this image is concerned, I started 
to see the details come back at about 5%,

03:56: whereas at about 10%, we're seeing 
too much of the noise come back.

04:00: So we have some good details inside the image 
including those tiny little hairs or whatever

04:04: they are at work in the foreleg.

04:06: However, we're also bringing back a ton of 
noise inside the mid tones and the shadows.

04:11: So, I ultimately scale that 
value back a little bit to 7%.

04:15: So, these were the values that I arrived at 
for what it's worth; Strength: 10, Preserve

04:19: Details: 7, Reduce Color Noise: 70, 
and of course Sharpen Details set to 0.

04:24: Remove JPEG Artifact is great if you have a 
highly compressed JPEG image, which this is not.

04:30: I applied the highest 
quality setting possible in fact.

04:33: So, we're not going to get much in 
the way of positive results with this.

04:36: However, if you find a public domain image 
on the Web for example that has had the heck

04:41: compressed out of it, then you might 
want to try that checkbox. All right.

04:45: Now let's go ahead and save our settings so 
we don't overwrite color noise by clicking

04:48: on the little Settings icon, and I'll just 
go ahead and call this one High Noise Image,

04:53: and then click OK, and of course, go ahead 
and select that setting from the end of the

04:58: list before you click on the OK button.

05:01: And just so you can see what we've managed 
to accomplish here, I'll go ahead, and turn

05:04: the Smart Filters off by 
clicking on the eyeball.

05:07: This is the amount of noise that was at work 
inside of this image originally, and I'll

05:11: just go ahead and zoom in to 200% so 
we can really see it in the video.

05:15: This is the original noise inside the image, 
and if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on a Mac

05:20: to reapply the filter, this is the 
image with the noise relatively defeated.

05:24: And that's how you go about applying the Reduce 
Noise Filter to about the highest noise image

05:29: you could possibly 
encounter here inside Photoshop.


 ** Smoothing over high-contrast noise

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you what to do if a 
single pass of Reduce Noise doesn't quite

00:04: get rid of all of the noise inside your image.

00:07: For example, this particular photograph contains 
a sufficient amount of noise, that even after

00:12: about the biggest application of Reduce Noise 
you could possibly apply, we're still seeing

00:18: a bunch of noise inside the midtones 
as well as inside the shadow detail.

00:22: Well, there're a couple of things you can do.

00:25: One is you can take advantage of the Advanced 
settings associated with a Reduce Noise filter;

00:30: and two, you can apply one of the old-school 
noise reduction functions, such as Dust & Scratches.

00:36: So let's start things off by double-clicking 
on Reduce Noise to bring up the Filters dialog

00:40: box and I'm going to zoom in on my 
image as well, so I can see it at 200%.

00:45: Notice as I click and drag inside the image, 
I am seeing the unmodified version of the

00:49: photograph as it appeared before I 
applied Reduce Noise in the previous movie.

00:52: All right, now I am going to click on the 
Advanced radio button to add an additional

00:56: panel called Per Channel.

00:58: Go ahead and click on it and drag inside that 
black-and-white preview right there in order

01:03: to see the appearance of the active 
channel, which by default is red.

01:07: So let's go ahead and start things off 
by just cranking up these values here.

01:11: I'll crank the Strength value up to 10 and 
I'll take Preserve Details down to 0%, and

01:16: I will do this on the 
channel by channel basis.

01:18: So I will now switch to Green, go ahead and 
crank it up to 10, take its Preserve Details

01:23: value down to 0%, and you can see now that 
we're applying additional applications of

01:28: both of these values to each 
one of these channels so far.

01:32: And we only have Strength and Preserve Details 
available to us because each channel is a grayscale image.

01:38: There is no such thing as 
Per Channel color noise.

01:40: All right, so now I am going to switch over 
to Blue and I'll take its Strength value up

01:44: to 10 and I'll take 
Preserve Details down to 0%.

01:47: And we're getting a very 
goopy looking image indeed.

01:51: We have done a great job of getting rid of 
the noise, but we're also doing a fantastic

01:56: job of getting rid of the sharp details.

01:59: So let's go ahead and take the 
Preserve Details values up a little bit.

02:02: I'll take the value for the Blue channel up 
to 5% because blue makes a smallest contribution

02:06: to detail inside of an RGB photo.

02:10: Then I'll switch to Red and I'll take its value 
let's say up to 25%, and then I'll switchover

02:15: to Green which makes the biggest contribution in detail 
and I'll take its Preserve Details value up to 40%.

02:23: Now the only way you're going to get a sense 
of the contribution made by your Per Channel

02:27: adjustments is to go ahead and click OK, 
because whether you turn off the Preview checkbox

02:32: or click and hold inside of the Image Preview 
here, you're seeing the uncorrected version

02:37: with no Reduce Noise applied.

02:40: So I'll go ahead and click OK, not only to 
update my image, but also to update my High

02:44: noise image settings.

02:46: And we'll see this version of the image.

02:48: Now you're going to have to watch very carefully to 
see the difference between the before and after.

02:53: If I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z, this is the 
before version of the image; if I press Ctrl+Z

02:58: or Cmd+Z again, this is the after version,
so just a little less noise inside of some

03:03: of the details such as the eye and the 
midtones, underneath this leg, and so forth.

03:08: If you want to make a bigger 
difference which, for this image, we do.

03:12: And you want to try one of the old-school 
noise reduction filters.

03:15: By going up to the Filter menu, choosing Noise, 
and either choosing Median or Dust & Scratches,

03:19: and they both work very similarly.

03:21: I am going to choose Dust & Scratches because 
it offers two options instead of just one.

03:26: If this were Median, we would have no 
threshold and we would just have this Radius value.

03:31: And what it does whether we're working in 
Dust & Scratches or Median is it averages

03:35: neighboring pixels inside 
of a radius around an edge.

03:39: So if I take the value up to six pixels we're 
scrubbing in six pixel circles around the

03:43: edges and averaging the results.

03:46: So we're gooping up the image 
tremendously of course as you can see here.

03:49: Now what I am going to do is scroll 
down to a lower region of the image.

03:53: This is a region of that green 
rock underneath one of the legs.

03:56: This threshold value which is what you need 
to Dust & Scratches, this is the only thing

04:00: that differentiates it 
from the Median Command.

04:02: What it does is it preserves the low 
contrast details inside the image.

04:07: So for example, if I set the threshold to 40 
levels, what I am saying if two neighboring

04:12: pixels or 40 luminance levels are less 
different from each other leave them alone which is

04:18: why we're bringing back the noise, but if 
the two neighboring pixels are 40 or more

04:23: levels different from each other, then go ahead and 
smooth them away according to the radius value.

04:28: So we're preserving the low contrast noise 
and we're getting rid of the high contrast

04:32: noise along with the detail.

04:34: And as a result you can see that we have 
some weird edges around the butterfly's eyes.

04:39: So I am going to take that threshold value 
down to 20 levels in order to get rid of some

04:44: of those problems, not all of them, we'll take 
care of the rest of them in the next movie.

04:48: But the great thing here is, for purposes 
of this image, because it does have so much

04:52: high contrast noise, it allows us to 
balance the noise inside the image.

04:56: So we're preserving some of the low contrast 
noise, we're getting rid of a lot of the high

05:00: contrast noise, and that ends 
up creating a kind of parity.

05:04: All right, now I'll go ahead and click OK in 
order to accept the results of this filter

05:08: and I will zoom out as well to 100%.

05:11: Scroll back up to the good detail inside the 
image so you can see that we've brought back

05:15: some of the edges, we've messed up other edges,
we've completely gotten the rid of the hair

05:20: on the insect's legs.

05:22: So if you turn Dust & Scratches off, you can 
see after a brief progress message, this is

05:27: the image as it appeared before Dust & Scratches,
and then if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on

05:32: the Mac, this is the image as it appears now.

05:34: So that's how you smooth away the worst of 
the noise inside of a high noise photograph.

05:39: It does come at the expense of the detail 
however, which is why you need to reinstate

05:44: the detail using an Edge Mask, and I'll 
show you how that works in the next movie.


 ** Protecting details with an edge mask

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you 
how to create an Edge Mask.

00:03: In our case, we'll be using it to protect 
the so-called edges, that is, the good detail

00:07: inside this image.

00:09: For example, I'll go ahead and turn Dust & 
Scratches off, it's very important to you do this

00:13: if you're working along with me, it may take a 
moment for Photoshop to re-render the filters

00:17: and you'll see that those little hairs along 
a forward leg comeback and we have better

00:22: detail inside the face and elsewhere as well.

00:25: So we need to be able to mask away the 
effects of these filters, so we can retrieve

00:29: that good information.

00:31: So with Dust & Scratch is off you want to 
switch over to the Channels panel and then

00:35: go ahead and grab your detail channel which 
is the green channel and drag it and drop

00:40: it onto the little page icon at the bottom 
of the panel and that goes ahead and creates

00:44: a copy of that channel, so we 
can transform it into a mask.

00:48: I'll go ahead and rename 
this channel edge mask.

00:51: And then step one is to go up to the Filter 
menu choose Stylize and choose Find Edges

00:57: which will go ahead and turn all the edges black 
inside the image and leave the non-edges white.

01:02: And you can see that Photoshop has gone 
ahead and traced around not only the edges, but

01:07: thanks to the fact that we left reduced noise 
turned on that effect is at least mitigated.

01:11: Now we want to make the edges thicker.

01:14: Anytime you want to increase the size of 
black inside of a mask, you go up to the Filter

01:19: menu, choose Other, and choose Minimum, so 
the idea is maximum will increase the size

01:25: of the maximum luminance level, which is 
white and, minimum will increase the size of the

01:30: minimum luminance level which is black.

01:32: Now this is a moderate resolution image and I 
want to preserve the slimmest edge as possible,

01:37: so I'm going to take that 
Radius value up to 2 pixels.

01:40: Now notice when you do that you end up 
creating a lot of squares inside of your mask, I'll

01:45: go ahead and zoom on in, and that's because you're 
effectively blowing up pixels inside the image.

01:51: To round off those squares go up to the Filter 
menu, choose Noise, and choose Median, which

01:57: is Dust & Scratches 
without the threshold setting.

01:59: So I'll go ahead and choose Median, and 
you want to match your minimum value.

02:03: So I've applied a Radius of two pixels with 
minimum, now I will follow up with Radius

02:08: of two pixels for median, and that goes ahead 
and turns all those squares into circles and

02:14: diamonds, so we get some rounded contouring.

02:16: I'll go ahead and click 
OK to accept that change.

02:19: Now you want to soften the edges and you do so 
by going to the Filter menu, choosing Blur,

02:24: and choosing Gaussian Blur and then you want 
the set the Radius value to half of what you've

02:29: been using so far.

02:31: So because we applied a Radius of two with 
minimum and median, we need a radius of half

02:36: that which is one pixel for Gaussian Blur, 
then click OK in order to accept that change.

02:42: All right, that finishes off the edge mask, 
believe it or not, and now what you want to

02:46: do is turn it into a filter mask.

02:48: So press the Ctrl key or the Command key on 
the Mac and click on edge mask in order to

02:53: load it as a selection outline, then switch back to 
the RGB composite image, switch back to layers.

02:59: I am going to press Ctrl+H or Cmd+H on 
a Mac to hide my marching ants, and then

03:04: I am going to turn Dust & Scratches back on.

03:06: Again, you're going to see a progress bar 
while Photoshop renders out that filter.

03:11: Next, you want to delete the existing filter 
mask by right-clicking on it and choosing

03:15: Delete Filter Mask, or if you loaded dekeKeys, 
you can press Ctrl+Alt+Q or Cmd+Opt+Q

03:20: on a Mac, and now we need to load the selection,
we're not seeing it, but it's still there,

03:26: as a filter mask by again right-clicking on Smart 
Filters and this time you choose Add Filter Mask.

03:32: And I want you to keep an eye on the butterfly 
here in the upper left corner of the Image window.

03:36: As soon as I choose Add Filter Mask, those 
edges come back throughout the image and we're

03:41: also seeing the hairs once again.

03:44: So if I was to Shift+Click on that Filter 
mask to turn it off, then you would see the

03:47: hairs on that forward leg go away, and then 
if I Shift+Click again to turn the filter

03:52: mask back on, all those 
wonderful fine details come back.

03:57: So thanks to the edge mask, we preserved the 
detail, we continue to get rid of the noise

04:02: however inside of the image, and you can see that by 
turning off the eyeball in front of Smart Filters.

04:07: There is our original noise vividly portrayed,
and if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on the Mac

04:12: again in order to reapply the Smart Filters, you 
can see that the noise is dramatically reduced.

04:18: And now that we have an edge mask, I am free to 
play around with my filter settings if I like.

04:22: So in my case, I am going to double-click on 
Dust & Scratches in order to bring up the

04:26: Dust & Scratches dialog box.

04:28: It may take a moment for Photoshop to process 
things, and I am going to tab to the threshold

04:33: value, and I'm going to take it down to the 
six levels this time instead of 20 and then

04:38: I'll click OK in order to apply that change.

04:40: And that makes an even bigger difference while 
having very little effect on those edge details,

04:47: and that's how you go about creating and 
employing an edge mask here in Photoshop.


 ** Adjusting overly saturated shadows

00:00: Another problem with this image is that we 
have some aberrantly colored shadows, so you

00:04: can see that we've got these warm shadows 
here inside of this kind of green rock or

00:09: whatever it is, and then we've got these purplish 
shadows inside of the butterfly's face and eyes.

00:16: And we're going to reduce those using a density mask 
combined along with a Vibrance adjustment layer.

00:21: So to start things off switch to the Channels 
panel and then we want to go ahead and load

00:26: the Green channel as the selection, and the 
reason we're using the Green channel is because

00:30: it has the most detail.

00:32: So go ahead and press the Ctrl key or the 
Command key on the Mac and click on that channel

00:37: in order to load it up.

00:38: That goes ahead and selects the lightest 
colors inside the image which would be great

00:42: if we had any problem with the highlights.

00:44: Our problems however are with the shadows, so 
we need to reverse this selection by going

00:49: up to the Select menu and choosing the Inverse command or 
you can press Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I on the Mac.

00:56: Now I'll go ahead and switch back to the 
Layers panel, and you want to press the Alt key

01:00: or the Option key on the Mac, dropdown to the 
Black/White icon at the bottom of the panel

01:05: and choose the Vibrance command.

01:07: Because you have the Alt or Option key down 
that will bring up the New layer dialog box.

01:10: And by the way, if you're using dekeKeys you 
can take advantage of that keyboard shortcut

01:14: Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+Shift+V on the Mac.

01:18: And I'll go ahead and call this layer 
Shadows and then click OK, and you'll notice that

01:23: Photoshop goes ahead and automatically 
converts that selection to a layer Mask.

01:27: So if I Alt+Click or Opt+Click on the layer 
Mask thumbnail here inside the Layers panel

01:32: then I'll see an exactly 
inverted version of the Green channel.

01:36: So we're going to apply the Vibrance 
adjustments to the bright versions of the mask while the

01:40: dark versions of the mask will 
remain protected. All right.

01:44: So I'll Alt+Click or Opt+Click on that 
layer Mask thumbnail again, then so I can

01:47: access my Vibrance options here in the Properties 
panel, I'll click on the Adjustment icon

01:52: which is that thing that looks like an 
upside down triangle or if you prefer a V.

01:56: Then I'll select the Vibrance value and I'm 
going to change it to -70 in order to achieve

02:01: this effect here.

02:03: The problem is so far we're reducing the 
saturation of the midtones and highlights more than

02:07: we want to, and we're not reducing the saturation 
of the shadows enough, and that's because

02:13: we need to increase the contrast of the mask.

02:15: So press the Alt key or the Option key on the 
Mac and click on that layer Mask thumbnail

02:19: so that we can see it there in the Image window,
and then bring up the Levels dialog box by

02:23: pressing Ctrl+L or Cmd+L on the Mac.

02:26: And I want to really protect those highlights 
and midtones that are represented by the darker

02:30: colors in the mask.

02:31: So I'm going to take my Black Point value up 
to 150, so we're clipping away ton of that

02:36: dark information.

02:38: And then Tab your way over to the White Point 
value and reduce it to 200, so there we were

02:43: brightening the shadows significantly and 
then go ahead and click OK in order to accept

02:48: that modification.

02:50: And now you can press the Alt key or the 
Option key on the Mac and click on that layer Mask

02:54: thumbnail again in order to switch 
back to the RGB Composite image.

02:58: And just to get a sense of what we've been able to 
accomplish now you can turn off the Vibrance layer.

03:03: So this is the before version of the butterfly 
with those purple shadows inside the face

03:08: and those warm shadows down 
below inside this Green background.

03:13: And this is the after version with those neutralized 
shadows as you can see, it's done a big number

03:18: underneath the butterfly here and those 
more neutral shadows inside the bug's face.

03:22: And that's how you correct the very common 
problem of aberrantly colored shadows, using

03:28: a combination of a Vibrance adjustment layer 
along with a Density mask here inside Photoshop.


 ** Correcting with High Pass and Lens Blur

00:00: In this movie we're going to further correct our 
image using a combination of High Pass and Lens Blur.

00:05: The function of High Pass will be to sharpen 
the details inside the image, and then the

00:10: function of Lens Blur will be to 
compensate for the elevated noise levels.

00:14: Now you could just go ahead and combine 
everything into a Smart Object in order to apply

00:18: High Pass as a Smart Filter, but the Lens Blur 
filter which is the second part of this cannot

00:24: be applied as a Smart Filter.

00:26: So we're better off using static adjustments.

00:29: So here's how we'll proceed.

00:30: First, make sure the top layer which is the Vibrance 
layer is active, and then press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E

00:36: or Cmd+Shift+Option+E to merge all the 
visible layers onto a new layer, and we'll

00:41: go ahead and call this New layer High Pass.

00:43: Then go up to the Filter menu, choose Other, 
and choose the High Pass command or if you

00:48: loaded dekeKeys you can press Shift+F10.

00:51: This is a pretty high resolution image, so 
I'm going to crank the Radius value up to

00:55: 4 pixels and then I'm going to click OK.

00:58: This is also going to permit us to see just how much 
noise still resides inside of this composition,

01:04: Now we don't want these colorful edges so 
go up to the Image menu, choose Adjustments

01:09: and then choose Desaturate, or if you've 
loaded dekeKeys you've got a keyboard shortcut

01:13: of mash your fist U.

01:14: Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U or Cmd+Shift+Opt+U 
on the Mac, and that results in a grayscale

01:19: version of this effect.

01:21: Now I need to drop out the grays and keep 
the halos around the edges by clicking on

01:25: the Blend mode pop-up menu in the upper-left-
hand corner of the Layers panel and changing it

01:30: from Normal to Linear Light, which is 
the most intense of the contrast modes.

01:35: And we end up getting this effect here and you 
can see that it does a real number on the image.

01:40: The detail is much sharper, but so is the 
noise, so this is a composition as it appeared

01:45: a few moments ago.

01:46: With the noise reduced dramatically, however, 
not entirely gone, and this is the version

01:51: of the image as it stands now.

01:53: With the noise once again 
elevated by the High Pass filter.

01:57: So what we need to do is create another 
layer of anti-noise underneath High Pass in the

02:03: form of Lens Blur.

02:05: So I'm going to turn High Pass off for a 
moment, click on the Shadows layer once again.

02:09: Let's create another merge version of the image by pressing 
Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E or Cmd+Shift+Option+E on the Mac.

02:15: This time I'll go ahead and rename the New 
layer Lens Blur, and I'll go up to the Filter

02:19: menu, choose the Blur 
command and choose Lens Blur.

02:24: And Lens Blur brings up this 
ginormous dialog box as you can see here.

02:28: Its purpose is to simulate the kind of blur 
you get when the lens element is out of focus.

02:34: By default the radius value is set to 15.

02:36: All I want you to do is crank 
the Radius value up to 30.

02:39: You've got tons of other controls to work 
with, none of which are going to do us a lick

02:43: of good where this specific effect is concerned.

02:46: So take Radius up to 30, don't worry about 
the others, and click OK in order to apply

02:51: that filter, and you'll get this 
dramatically blurred version of the image.

02:56: Now of course that ends up not only blurring 
away the noise, which is a good thing but

03:00: it blurs away the detail as well.

03:02: Now you can reinstate some of that detail 
by turning the High Pass layer back on.

03:07: And quite frankly, it's not a half bad effect.

03:10: In fact, if I turn both Lens Blur and High Pass off,
you see that we have this crazy level here.

03:16: I'll go ahead and zoom in.

03:18: This crazy level of edge artifacting, so we've 
got color fringing all over the place around

03:23: the bug's face, and when we turn those two 
layers back on, that artifacting goes away.

03:28: Now we have some strange halos and some other 
stuff going on, also we've lost lot of the

03:33: good color inside the image.

03:35: So what we need to do is mask the effects of 
both the Lens Blur and the High Pass layers,

03:40: and I'll show you how to do that 
quickly and easily in the next movie.


 ** Brushing away blur and sharpening

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to convert 
this sort of ghostly effect that we've achieved

00:04: so far into this final corrected version of 
the photograph by masking the contents of

00:10: both lens blur and high pass layers.

00:13: So I'll go ahead and switch to my image in 
progress here and turn-off the High Pass effect

00:17: so that we can focus our 
attention just on Lens Blur.

00:21: Now I am going to want to mask most of this 
effect away, so I will dropdown to the Add

00:25: Layer mask icon at the bottom of the panel, 
and I will press the Alt key or the Option

00:30: key on the Mac and click on it, and 
that will create a black layer mask.

00:34: Now I will go ahead and switch to the Brush tool,
which you can get by pressing the B key.

00:39: Right-click inside the Image window and make 
sure the Hardness is set to 0% because

00:43: we want some very soft transitions.

00:45: Then press the D key to instate the default 
colors, which when masking is white for

00:50: the foreground and black for the background, 
and then I am going to reduce the size of

00:54: my cursor a little bit and paint inside of 
this high noise area right there in order

01:00: to paint it back in, so that we are 
getting rid of the noise inside of this area.

01:04: Then I will increase the size of my cursor 
a little bit and paint away this stuff as well,

01:08: so you can completely for now paint 
over that rear leg, because after all it's

01:13: already out of focus.

01:15: And then I will go ahead and increase the 
size of my cursor a little more and paint

01:18: around this region.

01:19: All right, let's go ahead and zoom out so that 
we can apply some big modifications quickly.

01:25: Press the Right Bracket key several times 
in order to increase the size of my cursor

01:29: and paint along this region right here, and 
you want to take care that you don't paint

01:33: over the feelers too much 
or too far into the wings.

01:36: Although I'm going to violate that rule and 
paint way into the wing like so, and then

01:41: I will press the X key to switch my foreground 
color to black and reduce the size of my cursor

01:46: a little bit and paint some of those 
wing details back into place like so.

01:50: You also want to make sure to paint the face 
back in probably the top of the head and

01:55: I am reducing the size of my cursor by 
the way by pressing the Left Bracket key and you

01:59: want to paint back in the tops of the feelers as well,
so I will do that for both of those guys there.

02:06: And that takes care of most of 
it just to check your work.

02:08: Go ahead and press the Alt key or the Option 
key on the Mac and click the layer mask icon

02:13: there in the Layers panel.

02:14: And we've got some problems here and there, 
so I will increase the size of my cursor,

02:18: press the X key to switch the foreground color 
back to white and then I will paint some of

02:22: these regions in, like so, so that I am not 
leaving any gaps in the background there,

02:27: and I've also got a little bit of a gap down 
here in the lower left corner, so I will increase

02:31: the size of my cursor and paint that away, 
and I might paint right along here too.

02:36: All right, then Alt+Click or Opt+Click 
on layer mask icon in order to bring back

02:41: the full color composite image and go ahead 
and zoom in on the critter and I want to take

02:46: in that rear leg, it 
probably shouldn't be that blurry.

02:49: So I will reduce the size of my cursor to 
about this thick, which if I right-click inside

02:53: the Image window appears to be 35 pixels and 
I'm going to press the 5 key to reduce the

02:59: Opacity of my brush to 50% and then I will 
press the X key to make the foreground color

03:04: black and I will click right about there and 
then I will Shift+Click, Shift+Click like

03:08: so and then Shift+Click down into this region 
in order to reinstate some of the original

03:14: information from that leg, and I am painting 
a little more freehand now and then I will

03:18: Shift+Click again and Shift+Click my way back.

03:21: And then I will press the 0 key in order to 
reinstate an Opacity of a 100% and I will

03:26: paint back in some of the face just because 
I want to make sure I am not getting rid of

03:29: any of that good detail.

03:31: I'd rather have too much noise and too 
little detail inside of this photograph.

03:35: All right, that ends up 
looking pretty darn good.

03:38: Now we can bring back the high pass layer 
and as soon as we do, this unfortunate thing

03:43: is going to happen, we are going to bring 
back a ton of the noise, and the reason is,

03:47: because that high pass layer was based on 
the noisy version of the image as opposed

03:52: to the version of the image 
after we applied Lens Blur.

03:55: And this is particularly significant 
down here in this lower left region.

03:59: You can see it's just riddled with 
noise right here below the wing.

04:03: We are almost getting this kind of sculpted 
glass effect that is to say, it looks like

04:07: we are seeing the image through a 
shower door or something along those lines.

04:11: So here's the solution.

04:12: We don't have to regenerate 
the layer thankfully.

04:15: All you need to do is load this layer mask 
as a selection by pressing the Ctrl key or

04:18: the Command key on the Mac and clicking on 
the layer mask thumbnail there inside the

04:22: Layers panel, then switch 
to the high pass layer.

04:25: As you know from our discussion of sharpening 
back in Chapter 13 of the intermediate course,

04:30: the darken light edges associated with a high 
pass effect end up creating the halos that

04:35: afford us to see appearance of sharper details and 
anything that's gray just disappears on the layer.

04:40: So let's go ahead and fill 
the selection with gray.

04:43: So I will press the D key to make my foreground 
color black just so that we are working together.

04:47: You can see that I've got the HSB values that 
work inside the Color panel and you get those

04:52: sliders by going to the Color panel flyout 
menu and choosing HSB sliders and all you

04:57: need to do is change the Brightness value to 
50% like so, and then press Alt+Backspace

05:03: or Opt+Delete on the Mac in order to fill 
that area with gray, and as a result we end

05:08: up getting rid of that noise.

05:10: Now press Ctrl+D or Cmd+D on 
the Mac to deselect the image.

05:14: Also notice by the way here that we've got 
some very pronounced halos around those feelers,

05:19: and quite frankly that's too much sharpening.

05:21: So I am going to increase the size my brush 
cursor a little bit here and I ended up with

05:25: a size value of 125 pixels.

05:28: Make sure your Opacity value is set to a 100% 
and then just go ahead and paint up the feelers

05:32: like so in order to get rid of those halos.

05:36: Finally I want you to press the M key to 
switch to the Rectangular Marquee tool and we want

05:40: to downplay a little bit, the effects of 
that lens blur layer, so go ahead and click on

05:45: it to make it active and then press the 5 
key to reduce the Opacity of that layer to

05:49: 50% and the effect frankly is pretty subtle.

05:52: But that will help to eliminate the 
haloing around some of the blurry details.

05:56: All right, and just to give you a sense of 
what we have been able to achieve here,

05:59: I am going to press Shift+F in order to switch 
to the Full Screen mode and I am going to

06:03: go ahead press Ctrl+0 or Cmd+0 on 
the Mac to center my image on screen.

06:08: And now I've got this other version of the 
image open here, we'll go ahead and switch

06:11: to it, and the name of this image is Sharpened 
noise and the idea is this is what the image

06:16: would have looked like, if we sharpened it 
with high pass and we never did anything about

06:21: the noise, in other words we have color and 
luminance noise, popping out from this image

06:25: all over the place.

06:27: But thanks to the fact that we've mitigated 
the noise using a combination of reduce noise,

06:31: dust and scratches and edge mask and lens 
blur before we apply the high pass layer

06:37: we end up getting this much 
more desirable effect.


 ** Creating texture by adding noise

00:00: In this movie I'll show you a positive use 
for noise in which we create a kind of texture

00:05: in order to achieve the effect of the image 
having been painted onto a coarse paper background.

00:11: So we'll start where we left off in the last 
movie and we're going to click on the high

00:14: pass layer to make it active and then I'm going 
to create a New layer by pressing Ctrl+Shift+N

00:18: or Cmd+Shift+N on a Mac and we'll go ahead 
and call this layer texture and then click OK.

00:24: Next I want you to convert this layer to a 
Smart Object by going up to the Filter menu

00:28: and choosing Convert To Smart Object or if 
you loaded dekeKeys press Ctrl+, or Cmd+,

00:33: on the Mac. Now we're going to heap on a bunch 
of filtering effects, but first you want to

00:37: press the D key to establish the default 
colors of black and white for the foreground

00:42: and background respectively.

00:45: Then go up to the Filter menu choose Render 
and choose Clouds, and Clouds applies what's

00:49: known as Fractal Noise, meaning that it's 
a random noise pattern and you can change

00:54: it any time you like just by double-clicking 
on the word Clouds there in the Layers panel.

00:59: And notice every time, you double-click you 
get a different effect. We don't need that

01:03: Filter Mask, it's just junking up the panel, so 
right-click on it and choose Delete Filter Mask.

01:08: Now let's add some Noise to our clouds by 
going up to the Filter menu, choosing Noise

01:12: and choosing Add Noise, which I've given a 
keyboard shortcut of Shift+F7. Now if we'd

01:18: added some painterly effects to a photograph 
and then we wanted to turn around and match

01:23: the Noise Level in the photo, so everything 
looked organic, you would keep the Amount

01:27: value low, something in the range of 2 to 4%.

01:30: However, we want a big effect here, so I'm 
going to increase the Amount value to 20%,

01:36: set Distribution to Gaussian so that we have 
a higher contrast noise effect and then turn

01:41: on the Monochromatic checkbox to get rid of 
any color noise. Then click OK in order to

01:46: apply that effect.

01:48: Next we want to increase the size of our noise 
a little bit, because right now we just have

01:51: all this single pixel noise as you can 
see now that I've zoomed into the image.

01:56: To achieve larger noise you go up to the Filter menu, 
you choose Blur, and you choose Gaussian Blur,

02:01: which I have given a shortcut of Shift+F6, 
and then I'll set the Blur value to 2 pixels,

02:06: like so, and click OK. And then finally we 
want to turn this effect into a texture and

02:12: you do that by going to the Filter menu once 
again, this time you choose Stylize and now

02:17: you choose Emboss. And these are the values I 
want you to apply; an angle of 135 degrees,

02:22: a height of 2 pixels, and an amount of 500%, 
now click OK in order to create that texture.

02:29: And then finally you blend it with the composition 
by changing the Blend mode in the upper left-hand

02:34: corner of the Layers panel from Normal to 
Soft Light, and we'll end up achieving this

02:39: effect here. I am going to press Ctrl+0 
or Cmd+0 on the Mac to zoom back out.

02:43: Now that creates the effect of the Paper Texture 
but we still have yet to create this painterly

02:49: effect right here and we achieve this using 
yet another merge version of the composition

02:53: combined with a couple of 
filters and a Blend mode.

02:56: So I'm going to switch back over to a composition 
in progress, I am going to turn off the texture

03:01: layer. Click on the high pass layer to make 
it active and then press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E

03:05: or Cmd+Shift+Opt+E submerge all the visible 
layers onto a new layer. I'll call this layer

03:11: bleed because the colors 
are bleeding into the paper.

03:15: Because we want to work with editable filters,
go up to the Layers panel flyout menu and

03:19: again choose Convert to Smart Object. And 
then go up to the Filter menu, choose Noise

03:24: and choose Median, and I'm going to increase 
my Radius value to 8 pixels to really gum

03:30: up that detail as you see here.

03:33: So if were to click in the butterfly's face, 
this is what it look like in the first place,

03:36: this is what it looks like now, all gooed together by 
this high amount of averaging. Now I'll click OK.

03:43: And that gives us some pretty sharp edges. We 
want to diffuse them by going to the Filter

03:47: menu, choosing Blur, and this time choosing 
Gaussian Blur and I am going to match that

03:51: Radius value by setting it to 
8 pixels and then click OK.

03:55: All right, we don't need the Filter Mask like 
usual, so this I'll take advantage of that

03:59: dekeKeys keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+Alt+Q or 
Cmd+Opt+Q on the Mac, and I'll change

04:05: the Blend mode this time from Normal to Darken. 
So we're just keeping the information on this

04:10: layer that's darker than the stuff below it.

04:14: And now I'll turn a Texture back on and then 
finally I'm going to brighten up this composition

04:18: by clicking on the texture layer and then 
I'll drop down to the black/white icon at

04:22: the bottom of the panel. Press the Alt key 
or the Option key on the Mac and click on it,

04:26: choose Brightness/Contrast and I'll call 
this layer something like elevate and then

04:31: I'll then click OK.

04:32: I'll press Shift+Enter or Shift+Return on 
the Mac to highlight the Brightness value

04:37: and I'll take it up to 20 and then I'll tab 
to the Contrast value and take it up to 30

04:42: in order to create the final effect.

04:43: And by the way if you're not happy with the 
texture all you have to do is double-click

04:48: in the Clouds Filter associated with the texture 
layer. Photoshop may bring up an alert message

04:53: telling you that you're only going to see 
the effects of this one filter. It's actually

04:57: not true and I'm kind of sick of seeing this 
alert, so I'll turn on Don't show again and

05:01: click OK, and you'll see the texture 
regenerate and just so we have a little more seamless

05:05: transition time, I'll double-click in Clouds again 
and notice the scene changes in the background.

05:10: All right, I'll press the F key a couple of 
times in order to switch to the Full Screen mode,

05:14: and I'll go ahead and zoom in on my 
artwork, and this is the final version of

05:18: the artwork, including two different kinds 
of noise, Clouds and the Add Noise Filter

05:24: used to achieve a 
vibrant and compelling effect.


 ** The Camera Raw Detail panel

00:00: In this movie I'll introduce you to the 
Noise Reduction and Sharpening options that are

00:04: available to you in Camera Raw. So I went 
ahead and selected this guy, Noisy hair guy.tif

00:09: in Bridge and then pressed Ctrl+R or Cmd+R 
in the Mac in order to open Camera Raw.

00:14: And we have got two panels of Noise options 
available to us. There's the Detail panel,

00:19: which contains the corrective options; and 
then there's the fx options, which allow

00:23: you to apply special effects.

00:25: I am going to switch over to the Detail panel. 
And notice by the way, if I were to zoom out

00:30: a click, I'd see this message down at the 
bottom of the screen, which tells me, for

00:34: a more accurate preview, zoom the preview 
size to 100% or larger when adjusting the

00:38: controls in this panel.

00:40: This image is sufficiently low-res that I can 
see it at 100% by pressing Ctrl++ or Cmd++

00:45: on the Mac, even on my small screen.

00:47: Now, in Camera Raw 7, you don't, strictly 
speaking, have to be seeing the image at 100% to see

00:53: the effects of Noise Reduction and Sharpening, 
it's just that at 100% you get the best sense

00:58: of what's going on.

00:59: We are going to start off with these Noise 
Reduction options, which are as in Photoshop

01:03: divided into two groups; you have got these 
three luminance noise options and then two

01:08: color noise options.

01:09: I am going to start by cranking the 
Luminance option up to its maximum setting of 100%,

01:14: and then I'll reduce Luminance Detail to 0, 
and you can see that wipes out just about

01:19: all the luminance noise 
at the top of this image.

01:22: I'll press Ctrl++ or Cmd++ to zoom into 
200%. We just have a little bit of that high

01:27: contrast noise hanging on in the guy's forehead.
If you want to bring back some of your high

01:31: contrast edges, as well as your higher contrast 
noise, then you crank up this Luminance Detail

01:38: value. And at about 50%, you can see that 
we're bringing an awful lot of that noise

01:43: back into play, even though, as you can see 
here, if I zoom out, the lower contrast noise

01:48: around the perimeter of 
the image remains defeated.

01:51: Now, we also have this Luminance Contrast 
option, and you can barely tell the difference,

01:57: even if I crank it all the way up to 100%, 
you can barely see any difference when working

02:01: with the Luminance Detail option.

02:03: To really get a sense of what's going on, 
I'll take Luminance Detail down to 0 and now

02:08: I'll show you this is how the image looks 
when Luminance Contrast is set to 0, keep

02:12: an eye on those big groups of noise that are 
coming back in here. This is what things look

02:17: like if I crank the value up to 100%.

02:20: So as opposed to measuring the contrast 
between neighboring pixels the way Luminance Detail

02:25: does, Luminance Contrast looks for higher 
radius blocks of detail, which can sometimes

02:30: be useful for bringing back thick 
edges, while still defeating noise.

02:34: All right! I am going to go ahead and set this 
value down to about 50% and raise Luminance

02:38: Detail to about 25%, and you can see that gets rid 
of most of the luminance noise inside this image.

02:45: Now let's take a look at the Color Settings. 
I'll crank the Color value all the way up

02:49: to 100% and then take Color Detail down to 0,
and you can see that gets rid of a lot

02:54: of that color noise down here at the bottom 
of the image, but not quite as neatly as the

02:58: Reduce Noise feature inside of Photoshop.

03:01: So rather than completely eliminating the 
noise the way we have seen in earlier movies,

03:06: it tends to thicken up the noise, as you can 
see here. Now, Color Detail allows you to

03:11: bring back higher contrast color noise, as well as 
higher contrast color details inside the image.

03:17: However, we have got a little bit of a bug 
in this build. Notice how much color noise

03:22: we are now seeing when I have Color Detail 
cranked up to 100%, but that's because my

03:27: mouse button is down.

03:28: As soon as I release, the Preview resets to 
the same thing we saw when Color Detail was

03:33: cranked down to 0%, and yet, if I were to 
open this image in Photoshop by clicking on

03:39: the Open Image button, we would see 
more color noise than we see now.

03:44: So you only get an accurate preview, again, 
in this particular build of Camera Raw 7.

03:49: We can only preview the effects of the Color 
Detail setting when you're mousing down on

03:54: that triangle. All right. So just be aware of 
that when you're working inside the program.

03:58: I'll go ahead and take Color Detail down to 
50% and scroll the Preview, so we are more

04:02: or less centered on this guy's face.

04:04: All right. Now let's take a look at the 
Sharpening options. Now, these Sharpening settings are

04:09: not designed to sharpen the image the way we 
saw with say Smart Sharpen inside of Photoshop

04:14: back in Chapter 13 of the Intermediate course.
Rather, these options are designed for two

04:20: purposes; one is to firm up the detail that 
gets soften during the demosaicing process,

04:26: when the full color image is generated from the 
monochrome data that's captured by the camera.

04:30: And the other reason you might use these Sharpening 
settings is to account for the softening effects

04:34: of the Noise Reduction values. So you just want 
the image to look moderately sharp on screen.

04:40: That said, I am going to go ahead and crank 
the Amount value up to its maximum of 150,

04:44: so that we can see what's 
going on with the other options.

04:47: We have got a Radius value, which you can 
set as low as 0.5 and as high as 3. Most of

04:54: the time however you are going to want to 
leave it set to 1, as I will do here.

04:58: This Detail setting is an adjustable version of 
that more accurate checkbox, that's included

05:02: along with the Smart Sharpen Filter, and it 
might be more accurately called Sharpen Noise,

05:08: because that's what it ends up doing in most 
images. And certainly, that's what's going

05:12: to happen in this particular image.

05:14: Notice if I crank this value up, we are 
sharpening the contrast between neighboring pixels and

05:18: we are making a mess in particular of this 
image. Unless you are working with a very

05:22: low noise image, I recommend that you 
generally set the Detail value to 0.

05:28: Masking allows you to create an edge mask 
on the fly, and to get a sense for how it

05:33: works, I want to show you a tip that works 
with all of the sharpening options.

05:37: If you press and hold the Alt key or the Option 
key on the Mac and drag one of these triangles,

05:42: for example I am dragging the Amount triangle, 
then you'll see a luminance only version of

05:47: the image. So in this case we're seeing how 
Camera Raw sharpens just the luminance data

05:52: and never sharpens the color data.

05:54: You can also Alt+drag or Opt+drag the 
Radius triangle to see those dark and light halos

05:59: develop on the fly, and you can Alt+drag or 
Opt+drag the Detail triangle in order to

06:04: see that noise sharpening.

06:06: I am going to crank this guy back down. That's 
all very interesting, I think, but Alt+dragging

06:10: or Opt+dragging becomes most useful when 
working with the Masking setting, because

06:14: it permits you to actually preview the mask on the 
fly. So here I am Alt+dragging or Opt+dragging

06:20: on that Masking triangle and I 
can see what the mask looks like.

06:24: And bear in mind where masks are concerned, 
wherever we are seeing white, that area will

06:28: receive sharpening; wherever we're seeing 
black will not get sharpened. So I'll go ahead

06:33: and take this value up to say 65, and as 
soon as I release, you can see that just these

06:39: edges around the hair and the ear and the 
glasses and so forth, those are the only areas

06:44: that are receiving sharpening.

06:46: Notice also that the nose and the mouth and 
the chin are not getting sharpened, and the

06:51: reason for that is there's so little luminance 
information to work with; most of the distinctions

06:55: that we're seeing are 
color as opposed to detail.

06:59: All right, so that's how the Detail options 
work. In the next movie I'll show you how

07:03: to use them to correct a 
handful of digital photographs.


 ** Correcting noise and detail in Camera Raw

00:00: In this movie, I will show you how to use 
the options in the Detail panel here inside

00:04: Camera Raw to correct a trio of photographs; one 
low noise, one high noise, and one over the top.

00:10: Notice this vertical bar over here on the left
-hand side of the window. If I double-click

00:15: on it, I will bring back my filmstrip which 
shows that I have several images open.

00:19: If you need more room inside Camera Raw, you can double-
click on that vertical bar to hide the filmstrip.

00:24: I will go ahead and bring it back and I'll 
switch forward to this image; Roman theater.dng.

00:30: It has a low ISO, just 100. And it was shot 
during the day, so as a result, it's not going

00:35: to have much noise. What noise there is, is 
going to be most apparent in the low detail

00:39: portions of the photograph 
such as this region of clouds.

00:42: So, I am going to go ahead and zoom in to 200%. 
And what I like to do is crank the Amount

00:48: value up to its absolute maximum, so the noise 
is as obvious as possible. Next, I am going

00:53: to take the Luminance value up to 25, and 
otherwise, I am going to leave the values

00:57: set to their defaults. So, Luminance Detail: 50, 
Luminance Contrast: not going to make

01:02: much of a difference here, 
Color: 25, and Color Detail: 50.

01:05: Now, at this point, you may say, well, there's 
still a lot of noise visible inside that image.

01:10: That's because the Detail value is set to 25 
by default. I'm going to tell you I always

01:15: take that value down to 0 because it truly 
does do a better job of sharpening noise than

01:21: any of the detail inside of photograph.

01:23: Now, I'll take the Amount value down to 
something more reasonable such as 75, and then I will

01:28: press the Alt key or the Option key on the 
Mac, and drag that masking slider triangle

01:34: all the way up to 50.

01:35: So, once again those white edges will get 
sharpened. The black regions will not receive

01:40: any sharpening at all. But they will receive 
noise reduction. So noise reduction is applied

01:45: throughout the image.

01:46: Now, I am going to scroll up to the top of 
these columns here. And you'll notice that

01:51: we have some color fringing along the edges. 
That's chromatic aberration and it's going

01:55: to get exaggerated as you raise that Amount 
value. So, to get rid of it, skip over to

02:00: Lens Corrections, and then turn on the Remove Chromatic 
Aberration checkbox and that fringing will disappear.

02:06: Next, I will advance to Ventura harbor.dng. 
This is that night shot that started out so

02:12: very, very dark back in chapter 27. So, as a 
result, even though it has a low ISO, whenever

02:18: you expand the shadow information inside of 
an image, you're going to draw out noise.

02:23: So I am going to zoom in on this boat down 
here in the bottom of the image, and then

02:26: zoom in on it, so I'm seeing it at 100%. And 
you should be able to make out, there's just

02:31: a ton of noise at work inside this image.

02:34: So, I will switch back over to Detail, and I 
will go ahead and crank the Luminance value

02:38: up to its absolute maximum of 100, and then 
I'll go ahead and zoom in on the image, and

02:43: you can see, if you look closely here, that 
we've got some pockmarks of noise. And just

02:48: to make sure we can see that noise as well 
as possible, I'll crank the Amount value up

02:52: to 150. And sure enough, we have these smooth areas 
that are occasionally populated by regions of noise.

02:59: To get rid of those pockmarks, all we need to 
do is take the Luminance Detail value down

03:03: to 0, and now, I can demonstrate how well 
Luminance Contrast can work under these circumstances.

03:08: So if you take Luminance Detail down, then 
Luminance Contrast produces a more obvious effect.

03:14: Check out this shadow right here that's being 
cast by this blue line. It's barely visible

03:19: in the image right now. But if I take the 
Luminance Contrast value all the way up to

03:23: its maximum, then the shadow becomes more 
clear, and that's a good thing because that

03:27: shadow information is not noise, it's real 
detail. Now, I will take the Luminance Detail

03:33: value up to a point at which we see more detail 
inside the image without seeing those patches

03:38: of noise, and for me, 
that happens at about 25.

03:41: All right. There is a lot of Color Noise 
inside this image, so I am going to take the Color

03:45: value up to 75, and finally, I will take the 
Color Detail value down to 25. Now, you don't

03:50: have to work with these quarter values, I am 
just doing so to make it easy to follow along.

03:55: Now, of course I don't want this Detail value 
to set to 25 because notice I end up getting

04:00: these patches of noise around the real 
details in the photograph. But if I take the value

04:06: down to 0, then those areas of noise totally 
disappear. Now, I will press the Alt key or

04:11: the Option key on the Mac, and drag the 
Masking slider triangle all the way up to 50 here.

04:17: Those white edges will receive the sharpening,
the black areas will not. I will go ahead

04:21: and release my mouse button in order to apply 
the effect, and then finally, I'll take the

04:25: Sharpening value down to 
something more reasonable such as 50.

04:29: All right. Now I will zoom out to take in 
the image and you can see that it's just so

04:33: much smoother than it was before. If I press 
the P key to turn off the preview, this is

04:38: the original version of the image, and the 
noise is even more garish out here in this

04:44: empty orange region of water. And then, if I 
press the P key to re-invoke the preview,

04:49: you see that, that noise 
almost entirely disappears.

04:52: All right. Let's check out a worst-case 
scenario such as this JPEG image. The noise in this

04:57: image is most apparent up here in the sky. So,
I will go ahead and marquee it, and set

05:01: my zoom level to 200%. And you can see that 
we have some very choppy detail indeed along

05:07: with a massive amount of posterization.

05:09: Even though this is a colorful region of the 
image, this is Luminance Noise because, after

05:13: all, the color is fairly homogeneous. It's all 
blue. So, I am going to take that Luminance

05:18: value up to its maximum setting of 100, and 
crank the Luminance Detail value down to 0.

05:23: And we end up smoothing out those choppy 
So if I press the P key, this is the original

05:29: sky, and if I press P again, this is the smoother 
sky. So, we still have posterization, we still

05:35: have stair-stepping, all that stuff, but 
it's a lot smoother than it was before.

05:39: All right. I am going to zoom out a couple of 
clicks here, and now you can see the unfortunate

05:44: part of what I've done here is I have made 
the image look kind of plastic, especially

05:49: if we check out Colleen's face here. She is 
definitely over-smooth; so this is the before

05:54: version and this is the after version.

05:56: Now we do need some amount of smoothing in 
this region but not that much. So I will go

06:02: ahead and take the Luminance value down to 
75, and then I will increase the Luminance

06:06: Detail value to 50; don't need to worry about 
Luminance Contrast for this image. And that

06:11: brings back a lot of detail.

06:13: Now let's check out the Color Noise which is 
most obvious here inside Colleen's jacket,

06:18: and it could be made more obvious still if 
I take that Amount value up. So I will go

06:21: ahead and take it up to 150% for now, take 
the Detail value down to 0. And you can see

06:27: that in addition to the real sort of purplish 
blue of the coat, we have all kinds of violet

06:33: and green and blue noise showing up. 
There's also this little red spot there.

06:37: In an effort to defeat it, I am going to crank 
that Color value all the way up to 100%, and

06:42: I'll take Color Detail down to 0. And you 
can see that all of that noise goes away,

06:48: even most of that red dot which I would later 
turn around and fix using the Spot Removal tool.

06:54: But there is a downside to my extremely high 
values here. I will go ahead and zoom in on

06:58: the top of this red scarf. If I press the P 
key, this is the original version of the

07:02: scarf right there, so it was 
previously much more vivid.

07:05: I will go ahead, and press the P key to turn 
the Preview back on. We also have a little

07:09: bit of bleeding right here at the top of the 
scarf where it's eeking into the coat. We're

07:14: not going to get rid of that entirely, but 
we can tone it down a little bit by reducing

07:18: the Color value to 50, and then taking the 
Color Detail value up to 100. And that helped

07:24: solve that problem. It brings back a little 
bit of saturation in the scarf while leaving

07:29: the coat nice and smooth.

07:31: All right. Finally, I am going to go ahead 
and zoom out here to take in more of the image

07:35: at a time, and I will adjust my Sharpening 
settings by pressing the Alt key, or the Option

07:40: key on the Mac, and dragging the masking 
triangle up to 65 I figured for this image. The white

07:46: edges will get sharpened, the black areas 
will not, and then I will take the Amount

07:50: value down to something 
more reasonable such as 70%.

07:54: What I'm doing here, it's very important to 
know, is I'm sharpening in order to account

07:58: for the softening that's been applied by the 
Noise Reduction values. And that's how you

08:02: go about correcting the noise and detail in 
a few real-world photographs here in Camera Raw.


 ** Adding noise grain and vignetting effects

00:00: In this movie I'll show you how to use Camera 
Raw to apply noise and vignetting for effect.

00:06: So here we are looking at this image of these 
dinosaurs, and you can see here in the Basic

00:09: panel that I've applied a bunch of different 
modifications. I've also used the Adjustment

00:14: Brush in order to brush in a couple of adjustments 
exclusively inside the dinosaurs. And we have

00:21: some graduated filters as well and so forth.

00:24: And what that means is that we've stressed 
the image to the nines. Because if I go over

00:28: here to the flyout menu and choose Camera 
Raw Defaults, this is what the image looked

00:33: like originally, so I've really done a number 
on it. And even though that's really great,

00:37: if I press Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on the Mac, 
that I was able to pull off these sorts of

00:41: modifications, it comes at a price.

00:44: If I zoom in on the tyrannosaur's teeth, for 
example, you can see, because we modified

00:48: the blue of the sky and the orange inside 
of the monster independently of each other,

00:53: we've got some very brittle edges indeed, which is 
why I decided to turn this into an effect image.

00:59: If you press the C key to switch to the Crop 
tool, you'll see that I've applied radical cropping.

01:04: And I haven't done so with the intention 
of straightening the image, in fact,

01:08: I'vemade it more crooked than ever. So I'll go 
ahead and press the Z key in order to switch

01:12: back to the Zoom tool, so we 
can see the results of the crop.

01:15: I don't want people to look at this image 
and think, wow, where did you see those cool

01:19: metallic dinosaur sculptures? I want them to 
look at this image and think, how did you

01:24: survive being attacked by 
these terrifying monsters?

01:29: And so I am going to switch over here to the 
Effects panel by clicking on the fx icon.

01:33: And we've got these Grain options that allow 
you to add big chunky noise. And then we have

01:39: these Post Crop Vignetting options that allow you 
to add a vignette within your crop boundaries.

01:45: So I am going to start things off by taking 
the Amount value up to 75%, so that we have

01:50: a fair amount of noise going on. And I want 
to increase the size of that noise, because

01:54: if you take a look here, the noise is pretty 
small, it's not single pixel noise the way

01:59: you get with the Add Noise command inside 
of Photoshop, but it isn't large enough to

02:02: necessarily translate to print.

02:05: I want to chunk it up. So I am going to take 
that Size value up to 80, which really makes

02:09: me wish we had this kind of control 
when working with Add Noise in Photoshop.

02:13: Now I am going to take the Roughness value 
up to a 100 and that will give us this kind

02:18: of effect right there.

02:19: All right, I'll press Ctrl+0 or Cm d+0 on 
the Mac to zoom out, and then I'll go ahead

02:24: and adjust my Vignetting Amount.

02:26: Now, I'm not a big fan of vignetting effects, 
per se. They get way overused; there is sort

02:32: of the drop shadow of wedding photography. 
But in a case like this, where we're trying

02:36: to convey an element of danger and we want 
it to look like I barely got this snapshot

02:41: alive, I think it's appropriate.

02:43: So if you increase the Amount value, you're 
going to create a bright vignette, like so;

02:47: and if you reduce the Amount value, you'll 
end up producing a very dark vignette. I am

02:52: going to take mine down to -75.

02:56: And then I'm also going to reduce the Midpoint. 
And what that does is it forces the vignette

03:00: inward, so it's encroaching on the image; 
and ultimately I took that Midpoint down to

03:06: 15. Now that may look very wrong, because 
now can't really see the dinosaurs very well.

03:10: That's partially the point, but we can better 
reveal them by adjusting a few more values.

03:15: For example, if I reduce the Roundness value, 
then we're going to create some corners where

03:19: the vignette is concerned. And I want to 
take that Roundness value down to -60.

03:25: And next, I'm going to increase the Feather 
value slightly so that we have more softness

03:29: associated with the effect; 
take it up to 70 in fact.

03:32: And then finally, you have the option of 
bringing back the Highlights inside of the vignette

03:38: like so, and then helps to reveal portions of the 
sky, while giving the top of the tyrannosaur's

03:43: head a kind of burnt look. And we can see 
inside the braying mouth of the triceratops,

03:48: which makes him look a little 
more like an evil henchman.

03:50: Now, we have three Styles to choose from as 
well. We have Highlight Priority, which is

03:55: going to allow us to force the Highlights 
through the vignetting effect. You can also

03:59: go with Color Priority, which is going to 
force through areas of colors. And notice

04:03: the back of the tyrannosaur's head is now 
more visible, as is his back, and we can better

04:08: see the top of his head as well, so it 
doesn't look as burnt as it did before.

04:13: And then finally, we have Paint Overlay. I am 
not sure you'll ever want to use this one,

04:17: because it creates a very tepid effect indeed, 
especially when compared to the other options.

04:22: I think we get the most bang for our buck where 
this image is concerned with Highlight Priority.

04:27: All right. Now, at this point if I go ahead 
and zoom in on the mouth here, you can see

04:31: that those weird edges around the teeth 
aren't nearly so obvious as they were before.

04:36: So if I press the P key to turn all this stuff 
off, those are the original teeth; turn the

04:40: P key to turn all of this junk back on 
and here are the murkier teeth details.

04:45: That said, you may want to bring back some 
detail inside this image. So I am just going

04:50: to zoom out a couple of clicks here, so I 
can take in the tyrannosaurus' head. And I

04:55: am going to switch back over to the Detail 
values and I am going to experiment with these

04:59: Sharpening values.

05:00: Notice now if I press the Alt key or the Option 
key on the Mac and drag the slider triangle,

05:05: all of those effects are going to disappear 
and I just see the grayscale version of the

05:09: dinosaur by itself. So this helps me gauge 
the pre-effect sharpening, and then if I go

05:14: ahead and release, I can see 
the post effect sharpening.

05:17: Now, you're not going to make a terrific amount 
of difference because we have so much Grain.

05:22: However, these values will 
help the detail show through.

05:25: All right, now I am going to Alt+Drag or Opt+
Drag the Radius value so we can see those halos

05:30: independently of the effects. And I'll Alt+Drag 
or Opt+Drag the Detail slider down to 0,

05:35: so we can see the effects of 
this option independently as well.

05:39: And by the way, you can do the same with the 
Noise Reduction settings, at least where the

05:42: three Luminance sliders are concerned. So 
if I press the Alt key or the Option key on

05:47: the Mac and drag this Luminance slider triangle,
I will see the details smoothing on the fly,

05:53: again, independently of the effects. And then 
I'll Alt+Drag or Opt+Drag the Luminance

05:57: Detail slider triangle all the way to the 
left in order to apply as much smoothing as

06:03: humanly possible.

06:04: Now, because you need to see a color version 
of the image to gauge the results of the Color

06:08: setting, Alt or Option dragging doesn't produce 
any effect. So I'll just set the value to

06:12: its maximum, which is a 100, and then reduce 
Color Detail to its minimum, which is 0, and

06:18: that gives me my final image.

06:20: I'll go ahead and click on the Open Image button 
in order to open that file inside Photoshop,

06:25: and a moment later we'll 
see the image on screen.

06:27: All right, I am going to zoom in obviously, 
and press Shift+F in order to fill the screen

06:31: with the image, and that is the final version of my 
absolutely terrifying ordeal with the dinosaurs.

06:39: Thanks to our ability to add noise and vignetting, 
with an amazing degree of control inside Camera Raw.


 ** Blur Gallery

00:00: Photoshop offers around a hundred filters. Of those, 
14 are devoted to the task of blurring images.

00:07: In contrast, there are just 
five sharpening filters,

00:11: so almost three times as many devoted to the task 
of blurring your photos, which is crazy, right?

00:17: Sure, it makes sense to 
sharpen in post, but blur? Why?

00:22: And get this: three of the Blur filters are new to CS6.
We haven't seen a new sharpen filter in years.

00:29: Well, here's the reason. As upside-down as 
it sounds, blur focuses your attention.

00:35: Take this image for example. Low angle, 
decent composition. Highlights are pretty blown,

00:40: so that's not so good.

00:42: But the biggest problem: 
flat, flat, flat focus.

00:47: What are we supposed to look at?

00:48: The Wall Street Bull? Those little people 
on the left? Or is the real subject of the

00:53: photograph the trashcan?

00:55: Compare it to this. I've made a lot of 
changes, but mostly it's the focus.

01:00: The animal's ribs remain sharp, 
as do its shoulders and its face.

01:04: He exudes power, menace, maybe 
even a hint of Wall Street greed.

01:09: But whatever the subtext, 
this thing doesn't like you that much,

01:13: and it's coming at you.

01:14: I created this effect using the new Blur 
Gallery in CS6, which includes those three filters

01:20: I alluded a moment ago, which are 
Field Blur, Iris Blur and Tilt-Shift.

01:25: They are not compatible with Smart Objects, 
which is unfortunate, but otherwise they're amazing.

01:32: Here, let me show you exactly how they work.


 ** Creating depth-of-field effects in post

00:00: In this movie I'll show 
you how to use Field Blur.

00:02: Now, if you're working along with me and you 
open this image, brandnewgloves.jpg, which

00:07: is found in the 30 Blur Gallery folder,

00:09: it's going to initially open inside Camera Raw, 
because it has Camera Raw settings assigned to it.

00:14: In which case, just go ahead and click the 
Open Image button in Camera Raw to open the

00:18: photo in Photoshop.

00:20: Do not Shift+Click on the button to open it 
as a Smart Object, because Field Blur, and the

00:25: rest of the Blur Gallery, does 
not work with Smart Objects.

00:28: Now, you may recall that this image has a 
pretty ratty sky, and I'll go ahead and zoom in on

00:33: it to check it out.

00:34: We have got all this posterization. So what I 
decided to do in order to fix this problem,

00:39: because I really like the snapshot, is 
create a kind of depth-of-field effect, and Field

00:44: Blur is perfect for that.

00:46: So I'll go up to the Filter Menu, choose Blur, 
and then choose Field Blur. In fact, you can

00:51: choose any of these first three 
commands to bring up the Blur Gallery.

00:55: But because I know Field Blur is what I 
want, I'll just go a head and select it.

00:59: And I want to center my view by pressing Ctrl+0 
or Command+0 on a Mac, and then I'll zoom in.

01:05: Now, by default, you to get one 
Blur control, and that's it--

01:08: I am going to go ahead move it over to this 
location--which might seem silly. Why bother

01:12: to move it when it's blurring 
the entire image uniformly?

01:17: Well, the truth is that you can set more than 
one of these pins in order to vary the blur

01:22: across the image.

01:23: So, I'll start with this one set to its 
default Blur value of 15 pixels, as you can see in

01:28: the upper right-hand corner.

01:30: And then I'll go ahead and reestablish the 
focus in Colleen's face by clicking somewhere

01:35: on her nose right there. And I'll either reduce 
the Blur value up here in the Blur Tools Panel

01:41: to 0 pixels or you can also 
drag inside of this ring.

01:46: So if you drag in a clockwise fashion, you'll 
increase the Blur at that location; if you

01:50: drag in a counter-clockwise 
fashion, you'll reduce the blur.

01:54: So reduce the blur to 0, just drag right 
next to the top, so you should be that exactly

02:00: at noon, because that going 
to expand the Blur value.

02:03: Instead, you want to move to about 12:15 on 
the dial there, and you'll get a Blur of 0,

02:08: and then go ahead and release 
in order to see the effect.

02:11: All right, now what we've done is we've created 
a blur that's basically traveling horizontally

02:16: across the image.

02:17: So as things stand now, the right side of the image is 
in focus and the left side of the image is blurred.

02:23: We need more control that that,

02:25: so we need to lay down more pins, and you 
can even lay down as many pins as you like.

02:28: I am going to click to 
set one right about there.

02:31: And for the sake of expediency, I'm just 
accepting that default Blur value of 15 pixels.

02:36: I'll go ahead and set one right about there as 
well, in order to blur inward into Colleen's

02:41: face, because the last thing that we want is 
some sharp details surrounding her, because

02:46: that wouldn't make any sense,

02:47: that portions of this railing, for example, are out 
of focus and then also other portions are in focus.

02:53: Now, I'll go ahead and set 
a pin at this location.

02:55: If you find that you're encroaching too much 
on the subject of your photograph, as I am

03:00: in this case--notice that I'm blurring into 
the top-left region of my friend's head--then

03:05: you just want to back it off.

03:06: Now, as you drag the pin, you're not necessarily 
going to get the best feedback. You have the

03:10: release in order to see the blur resolve.

03:14: And at this point I can see that I'm 
still encroaching in her hair too much,

03:17: so I'll go ahead and drag up to maybe about 
here and see what that looks like, and that

03:22: ends up resolving pretty nicely.

03:24: All right, now I'm going to set 
another pin at this location.

03:28: And now notice that we've some blurry 
details inside of Colleen's body, specifically on

03:33: her hand. We don't want that, because she's 
showing off this new pair of gloves I brought her,

03:37: so I want to make sure they are in focus. 
So I'll go ahead and click to set a pin right

03:41: there on the glove and dial 
it down to Blur value of 0.

03:45: And I'll create another pin right there on 
the collar, dial it down to 0 as well, and

03:50: I'll set one on the shoulder right about there, 
looks pretty good to me, and I'll dial it down to 0.

03:55: Obviously, I'm pretty familiar with this image, 
and I have worked through it. What you'll find

03:59: when you're approaching a new photo is that 
you have to click to set pins and move them

04:04: around, especially when 
things get as elaborate as this.

04:07: Now, notice that the water is coming back 
into focus right there. That doesn't make any

04:10: darn sense at all,

04:12: so I'll set a pin here and I won't change 
its focus, so I'll leave it set to a Blur

04:16: of 15. And I'll set another one right about there 
I think. That should work out pretty nicely.

04:21: Just a couple of more 
points are bugging me here.

04:24: This area of water should be more out of focus,
so I'll click right about there in order to

04:29: set another Blur point.

04:31: Finally, I want this stretch right in between 
these two points to blur incrementally, so

04:36: I'm going to set a pin right 
about there, above the collar.

04:40: I want to dial it down to a 
Radius of 10, and then I'll release.

04:44: All right, now let's say you like what you're 
seeing and you want to check it out in Photoshop.

04:49: Then go ahead and click the OK button.

04:50: But here's the caveat: you're permanently 
assigning your changes, and the only way to

04:55: revisit your pins again in the future is to 
press Ctrl+Alt+F or Command+Option+F on a Mac.

05:01: So you'll want to make sure, after clicking OK--
and of course, wait for the progress bar

05:05: there--and checking out everything inside 
Photoshop, that you don't go and choose a

05:10: different filter, such as 
Smart Sharpen for example,

05:14: because then that will be 
the last filter applied.

05:17: You want instead take some time to evaluate 
the image and make sure you like it.

05:22: That way if you don't like what you see, you can 
make modifications, and I'll show you how

05:26: that works in the next movie.


 ** Modifying your Field Blur settings

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to modify 
your Field Blur settings after you apply them.

00:05: So right now we're in a pretty tenuous spot.

00:07: My image is looking pretty good, but if I 
scroll down here, I can see that this pavement

00:12: edge is in sharper focus than I would like, 
and Colleen's arm is too blurry, and so forth.

00:18: And then if I scroll up to the top of the image, 
I can see that the sky isn't blurry enough.

00:23: So I want to modify my settings, but I just 
applied static adjustment to a flat image,

00:29: which was a really bad idea.

00:31: So, what I want to do at this point is press 
Ctrl+Z or Command+Z on a Mac to undo that

00:36: modification, and then I am going to press 
Ctrl+Alt+J or Command+Option+J in order to

00:42: create a copy of my image, and I'll 
call it "field blur" and then click OK.

00:47: That way the original image is still safe.

00:50: Now, instead of going to the Filter menu and 
choosing Blur and choosing Field Blur, which

00:55: would wipe out my previous settings, I'm going 
to take advantage of the fact that the Blur

00:59: Gallery was the last filter I applied.

01:02: So that means I can apply that same filter 
with new settings by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F or

01:08: Command+Option+F on the Mac, and then I will 
see all of my pins here inside the image.

01:13: All right, I am going to press Ctrl+0 to zoom 
out, and then I'll zoom back in again. And now

01:18: let's make some further modifications.

01:20: Now, I want to scroll down using the scroll 
wheel on my mouse, but if I do that, because

01:25: the Blur value is highlighted, I'll actually 
scroll down my Radius value, and that's not

01:29: what I want, so I'll go 
ahead an scroll it back up.

01:32: I need to deselect this guy right here, and you 
do that by Ctrl+Clicking or Command+Clicking

01:37: on it. Then I'll scroll down to the bottom of the 
image, and I'll click to set a few new points.

01:43: Now, by the way, you may find that you 
accidentally click to set a point and you don't like

01:47: that pin. Then to get rid of it, the active 
pin right there, press the Backspace key or

01:53: the Delete key on the Mac.

01:54: If you want to get rid of all your pins, 
then you go up to this option and click on it,

01:59: but be very sure that's what you want to do, because 
you'll get rid of every single pin in the image.

02:04: All right, now I am going to set a couple 
of pins down over here, so I'll set one at

02:08: this location and another here, and that'll 
ensure that that pavement is nice and blurry.

02:13: And then I'll set a pin inside Colleen's arm 
and I'll dial it down to 0, because that

02:18: wants to be in focus. And this edge of the 
glove is getting a little out of focus as

02:22: well, so I'll click to set a pin 
there and drag its value down as well.

02:27: And now this edge of her arm is looking to me 
like it should be in better focus, so I'll

02:31: click right about there and dial down the 
blur value to 0. Unfortunately, and fairly

02:36: predictably, that ends up sharpening the 
focus of some of the water, so I'll click to set

02:40: another blurry pin at this location.

02:42: All right, now let's go ahead and scroll up here 
so that we can see the very top of the image.

02:48: And now I want to make the sky blurrier, 
so I'll click right there to set a pin, and I'll

02:54: drag it up to a value of 25, is what I am looking 
for, and I'll click to set another very blurry

03:01: pinpoint right there, and 
I'll drag it up to 25.

03:05: And notice, if you want more control, you can 
move your cursor farther away from the pin,

03:09: and that way small movements 
won't make such a difference.

03:13: And now I'll click there, and I'll go ahead 
and start dragging inside the ring and then

03:16: move my cursor farther out in order to get 
exactly 25, which is what I am looking for.

03:21: That makes this section of the bridge too 
blurry, so I'll go ahead and set a new blur

03:25: point. It comes in by default 
at 15, and that's just fine.

03:30: Okay, a couple of more tricks 
you might want to know about.

03:33: I will go ahead and scroll the image back 
up here so it's more or less centered.

03:36: If you want to hide all the pins, you can press 
Ctrl+H or Command+H on the Mac; to bring them

03:41: back, you press Ctrl+H or Command+H again.

03:44: If you want to hide the pins temporarily, 
you press and hold the H key. So as long as

03:48: the H key is down, the pins are hidden; if you 
release the H key, then the pins come back.

03:54: Then finally, you can press the P key to turn 
off that Preview checkbox up there at the

03:58: top of the screen, and then if you want to turn the 
preview back on, you just press the P key again.

04:04: All right, now, let's say I make a modification.
I'm thinking this area along the left side

04:08: of Colleen's face is not quite blurry enough, 
so I'm going to go ahead and drag this pin in.

04:14: If you think better of your adjustment 
after you make it, you do have one undo.

04:18: So you can press Ctrl+Z or Command+Z on the 
Mac to undo that change, and then you can press

04:23: Ctrl+Z or Command+Z on the 
Mac to redo that change.

04:27: That is a little too close now, so I'll just 
drag it out until we get to a position where

04:31: we have a nice amount of blur and yet 
Colleen's eyes, which are the most important element

04:35: of a portrait shot, remain in focus.

04:38: All right, so that looks pretty good to me, 
so I'll go ahead and click the OK button in

04:42: order to apply my modifications.

04:45: So there you have it, friends.

04:46: That's how you apply Field blur 
nondestructively to a copy of your original image, and how you

04:52: modify the last settings you 
applied when using the Blur Gallery.


 ** Editing and exporting a Field Blur mask

00:00: Field Blur and the other Blur Gallery effects work 
their magic by automatically generating masks.

00:06: So in this case, we have a mask that's 
protecting Colleen from the blur that surrounds her.

00:12: In this movie, I'll show you not only how 
to view that mask, but how to modify it and

00:17: export it to the Channels panel as well, and 
then we'll turn around and mask Colleen against

00:22: the sharply focused background.

00:24: So for starters here, because we are going 
to make some modifications, I am going to

00:28: turn off the Field Blur layer,

00:30: click on the background item here inside the 
Layers panel, and press Ctrl+Alt+J or Command+Option+J

00:34: on the Mac to make another copy of it.

00:37: And I will call this new layer 
2nd pass and then click OK.

00:41: So now that we once again have a copy of 
the sharply focused version of the image,

00:44: I will Press Ctrl+Alt+F or Command+Option+F on 
the Mac to revisit the Filter Gallery, complete

00:51: with all of my previously applied pins.

00:53: Now there're two ways to view the 
mask, and they both involve the M key.

00:57: If you press and hold the M key, you'll see 
the mask temporarily, and then you can release

01:02: the M key in order to 
return to the full-color image.

01:05: If you want the mask to remain onscreen 
so that you can modify it, then tap the M

01:09: key, and then of course you tap the 
M key again to return to the image.

01:14: I am going to tap the M key in 
order to bring up the mask.

01:18: Now, wherever you see black, the image is 
protected from the blur. And in this case, we have got

01:23: this big blob of black that's 
surrounding and protecting Colleen.

01:27: Wherever you see gray, you're getting partial 
blurs, and then wherever we have white inside

01:34: of the mask, we are seeing 
the full effect of the blur.

01:37: And in our case, the whiteness surrounds each one of 
the pins that are set to a radius of 25 pixels.

01:43: Now in so far as masks going, this is 
pretty rough, but it's good enough to do the job,

01:49: except for down here in the area 
occupied by our model Colleen.

01:54: Notice that we have a few gaps in the 
blackness, meaning that we are slightly blurring the

01:58: areas inside the subject of our photograph.

02:01: So what I am going to do here is set 
some points to eliminate that dark gray.

02:04: When I first click with a tool, I am going to 
create some brightness, because after all,

02:09: the blur is set by default to 15 pixels.

02:12: If I go ahead and take that blur value down, 
you can see, that creates blackness inside the mask.

02:18: Now, I will set another pin at this location 
and I'll go ahead and dial it down as well

02:22: to darken the mask, and I will click right 
about here, which should be the neck region,

02:27: and I will dial it down as well. And we get 
these nice solid areas of black, as you can see.

02:33: All right, now let's check our work by 
pressing the M key to switch back to the full-color

02:37: image, and it looks like we've 
done a pretty splendid job.

02:41: Now, the only thing I am uncomfortable with 
is the fact that the left side of Colleen's

02:46: face is getting a little too much attention 
where the blur is concerned, and so it's encroaching

02:51: on her eye. But we will go ahead and solve 
that problem inside the larger composition

02:55: in just a moment.

02:56: In the meantime, what I would like you to do 
is go ahead and turn on Save Mask to Channels,

03:01: which is just a great idea in case you ever 
have to revisit that mask in the future.

03:06: Then, assuming you're comfortable with what 
you have, go ahead and click on the OK button

03:10: in order to apply that effect.

03:12: And you may have to wait a few moments for 
the progress bar, because this is a pretty

03:16: processor-intense operation.

03:17: All right, now if I switch over to the Channels 
panel, I can see that I have a new alpha channel

03:23: that's called Blur Mask, and I can load that 
as a selection outline and use it to mask

03:28: the image in other ways anytime I like.

03:30: All right, now I will switch back to the RGB 
image and return to the Layers panel. What I really

03:35: want to do is use a layer mask to mask away some of 
the blurriness associated with this 2nd pass layer.

03:41: So I will go ahead and drop down to the Add 
Layer Mask icon at the bottom of the panel,

03:45: and I will click on it in 
order to create a layer mask.

03:48: And now I will get my Brush tool, which you 
can get by pressing the B key. I will right-

03:53: click inside my image, so you can see, I am 
starting with the Size value of 175 pixels

03:57: and the Hardness is set to 75%, which will give 
us a little bit in the way of soft transitions

04:03: while at the same time allowing 
us to paint in some focus.

04:06: So now I will press the Enter key or the 
Return key on the Mac in order to hide that panel.

04:10: Make sure your foreground color is black by 
pressing the D key and then the X key, and

04:15: I am going to paint right about there inside of 
the caller and down here along the shoulder.

04:21: And what we're doing is we are painting down to the 
background, which is sharply focused throughout.

04:27: Now I will paint up the side of Colleen's 
face right there and over the flesh tones,

04:31: into her eye, and up in to the hair as well. 
And I might paint slightly into the ear there

04:37: in order to reestablish some of that focus.

04:41: And if you feel like you want to go a little 
farther with this, you can zoom on in, so

04:44: you can better see what you're doing, and then 
in my case, I am going to paint down the side

04:48: of her face, so we get a 
little of that structure back.

04:52: You don't want to go too far, because if you 
do, after all, you'll unblur the background,

04:56: which is the great problems.

04:58: And I have done that, so I will go ahead and 
reduce the size of my cursor, press the X

05:02: key so I can now paint with white, and I will paint 
back in some of that blur, as you see me doing now.

05:07: So in my experience with the blur gallery by 
the way, if you're going to go this route,

05:11: if you want to paint in blurs in some areas 
and paint them away in others, is that you're

05:15: best off blurring too much of the image.

05:18: That way you can paint 
back in the focus later.

05:21: All right, I am going to press the X key to 
switch my Foreground Color back to black, and

05:25: I might paint back up into the hair a little 
bit as well, as long as I am zoomed in, and

05:29: I can see what I am doing.

05:30: I don't want to paint too far into the ears, 
because I want them to sort of decline out

05:35: of focus there. But I might want to bring 
back the detail like the earring and the side

05:39: of the neck, and I will go ahead and paint 
back in the edge of this collar as well.

05:43: All right, that looks pretty good to me.

05:44: I will press Ctrl+0 or Command+0 to zoom on 
out there and then go ahead and scroll down

05:50: inside of the image as well. And now I will press 
Shift+F in order to switch to Full Screen mode.

05:55: Go ahead and scroll down little more here, 
zoom in as well. And just to give you a sense

05:59: of what we have been able to accomplish here,
this is the original unblurred version of

06:04: the scene, and this is our depth-of-field effect 
that we have created in post using the Field

06:09: Blur filter, combined with some very 
basic masking, here inside Photoshop.


 ** Adding a synthetic light bokeh

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to add a 
synthetic bokeh to your depth-of-field effect and when

00:05: I say bokeh I mean the one that spelled 
either b-o-k-e or if you prefer Adobe's spelling b-o-k-e-h.

00:12: And it's essentially the interplay of 
light, the iridescence of the Blur effect.

00:18: And I want to create a little action down 
here inside the highlights in the canal,

00:22: so I am going to select the Background, press 
Ctrl+Alt+J or Command+Opt+J on a Mac, and I'll

00:27: call this new layer 
"canal bokeh" like so, and then click OK.

00:32: Now I'll drag that layer above the 2nd 
pass layer, because we're going to eventually

00:35: mask it into place, and I'll press Ctrl+Alt+F or 
Command+Opt+F on the Mac in order to revisit my pins.

00:43: Now, you get to the Bokeh options here inside 
the Blur Effects panel, but it's very possible

00:48: the panel will be collapsed.

00:50: If so, double-click on words Blur 
Effects in order to bring up these options.

00:54: Now I'm going to crank up this 
Light Bokeh value to 55%, like so.

01:00: Notice that that just blows the heck out of 
the highlights toward the top of the image,

01:04: and we'll address that in just a minute.

01:06: But you'll also notice that the Bokeh is fairly 
neutral; in other words, we have white blown

01:10: highlights that transition into the 
original colors inside the image.

01:14: If you want to light up those edges, 
then you increase the Bokeh Color value, and I'm

01:18: going to take it all the 
way up to 60%, like so.

01:22: Now at this point I've affected the highlights 
at the top of the image, but I'm not affecting

01:26: any of the light that's 
being cast onto the canal.

01:29: And you can change the range of luminance levels 
that are affected using this Light Range slider.

01:35: So notice right now we're affecting any luminance 
levels between 210 and 255, so just the brightest

01:41: luminous levels inside the image.

01:43: I'm going to drag this black slider triangle 
all the way down to 115, like so, and that's

01:48: going to light up these highlights, really these 
midtones in the lower-left region of the image.

01:53: And now to better focus the effect on those 
midtones, I'll go ahead and drag the white

01:58: slider triangle down to a value of 160,
is actually what I'm looking for.

02:03: So I'll just go and nudge that value up. And you 
can see that ends up giving us these wonderful

02:08: highlights on the water.

02:09: Now, that really messes up the details at the 
top of the image, and I have all these crazy

02:13: color effects going on.

02:15: But that's okay, because we're 
going to mask that region out.

02:18: So once you achieve an effect like I have 
here, go ahead and click the OK button in

02:23: order to apply about that blur to the active 
layer. You'll get the progress bar once again.

02:28: And then once it's finished, because we want 
to mask away most of this layer, drop down

02:32: to the Add Layer Mask icon at the bottom of 
the panel and then press Alt key or the Option

02:37: key and click on it,

02:38: and that will mask that entire layer away.

02:41: Then go ahead and grab the Brush tool, 
which you can get by pressing the B key.

02:45: I still have my Hardness value set to 75%, as you 
can see if I right-click inside the image window.

02:50: So I'll go ahead and press the 
Enter key to hide that panel.

02:53: Now I'll press the D key in order to establish 
white as my foreground color, and I'll begin

02:58: painting those highlights 
into the water, like so.

03:01: Now I might want to scroll down, just to make 
sure that I'm painting all the way to the

03:05: bottom of the image. Then I'll reduce the 
size of my cursor and paint in a couple of

03:09: other highlights over this location.

03:11: But I don't want to go too far with it. 
If you start painting over like that, we end

03:15: up getting an effect that's 
not quite that realistic.

03:17: Anyway, I'm going to press the X key in order 
to switch the foreground and background colors,

03:22: so I can paint with black, and then I'll 
paint these little bits of highlight away.

03:25: And I think that's actually pretty interesting 
effect, although I might want to get rid of him.

03:30: All right, you can do what you want, make 
whatever aesthetic choices seem right to you,

03:34: but this is the effect I was going for.

03:37: So I'll press Shift+F once again to switch 
to the Fill Screen mode, and I'll scroll down

03:41: a little bit as well.

03:43: And that is my final synthetic bokeh, thanks 
to the Blur Effect options that are available

03:48: to you anytime you're 
working inside the Blur Gallery.


 ** Using the Selection Bleed option

00:00: In this movie I'll introduce you to 
selection bleed, and the idea is this:

00:04: If you select a portion of an image and you 
apply any of the filters in the Filter Gallery,

00:09: then you can choose whether or not to bleed the 
deselected portion of the image into the selected region.

00:15: Now when you're using a filter like 
Gaussian blur, this happens automatically.

00:19: The great thing about Field Blur and the others 
is that it doesn't happen automatically, and

00:24: I'll provide you with a couple of examples.

00:27: Over the course of this first project, which is 
going to bleed, if you will, into the next movie.

00:31: we're going to take this Wall Street Bull 
from the Fotolia Image Library and we're going

00:35: to turn it into something that has a lot more impact, 
a much more interesting composition in my opinion.

00:41: So, let's start things off by 
making a copy of this Smart Object.

00:45: Notice I have a Smart Object selected.

00:48: And if you go up to the Filter menu, you'll 
see that there aren't that many filters that

00:52: you can't apply to a Smart Object.

00:55: There's Liquify and there's Vanishing Point, 
and the only other ones are located in the

00:59: Blur submenu, and they include the first 
three filters, which comprise the Filter Gallery,

01:04: and then we've got Lens Blur.

01:06: So everything else can be 
applied to a Smart Object.

01:09: So what do we do in this case? How do we turn 
this Smart Object into a flat image layer?

01:14: Well one way to work is to press Ctrl+A or 
Command+A on a Mac in order to select the

01:18: entire image and then press Ctrl+Alt+J or 
Command+Option+J on a Mac in order to jump

01:24: the selection to a pixel-based layer. 
And I'll go ahead and call this layer backdrop

01:29: and then I'll click OK.

01:30: And we now, as you can see by the lack of 
little page icon here in the thumbnail, we

01:36: now have a flat image layer.

01:37: Now I want to select a region of the image 
by switching to the Channels panel, and you

01:41: can see I have a couple of 
alpha channels set up in advance.

01:44: Recall that white represents the selection 
and black represents the deselected area.

01:49: So I start by drawing this basic selection 
outline using the Polygonal Lasso tool.

01:54: Then I used the Refine Edge command in order 
to clean it up, and we'll learn more about

01:59: Refined Edge in a later 
chapter in this course.

02:02: But for now what I want you to do is just 
load this selection by Ctrl+Clicking on the

02:05: Refine Edge Channel; on a Mac 
you'd Command+Click on it.

02:09: Then switch back to the RGB image, switch 
over to the Layers panel, and because we want

02:13: to blur the background and not the bull, 
we need to reverse the selection by going up

02:17: to the Select menu and choosing the Inverse command. 
Or you can press Ctrl+Shift+I or Command+Shift+I on a Mac.

02:23: All right, now just to make sure that we're 
starting from scratch and we're not applying

02:27: any old settings, just go to the Filter menu, 
choose Blur, and once again choose Field Blur.

02:32: And you'll end up seeing this number here, 
with the marching ants surrounding the selected

02:36: background and a single default pin 
set to a Blur Radius of 15 pixels.

02:41: All right, I am going to drag this pin to this 
region there, right under the animal's arm,

02:47: and I'm going to increase the amount of Blur. 
Just so we can really tell what's going on

02:50: here, I am going to increase it to 30, 
by dragging clockwise inside the ring.

02:54: And then I'm going to set another blur point 
down here by clicking, and I am going to decrease

03:00: its Blur value to 4. I don't want to send it all the 
way to 0; I want to keep some blurriness there.

03:06: And these two, you want to make sure that these two 
pins are more or less in line with each other.

03:11: And you have to do that manually, by the way; 
you're just going to have to eyeball it.

03:15: But you can check the mask if 
you want to, by tapping the M key.

03:19: And if the M key doesn't stick, by the way, if 
the mask ends up blinking in and then blinking

03:23: out, just tap the M key more quickly.

03:26: And what you should see is a pretty straight 
gradient. You don't want to see a lot of angle

03:30: to this gradient.

03:31: All right, I am going to tap M again and now notice 
this Selection Bleed option right there. It's set to 0%.

03:36: I am going to press, by the way, Ctrl+H or 
Command+H on a Mac to hide the marching ants.

03:41: That also goes ahead and 
hides my pins, by the way.

03:44: Right now, it's set to 0%, which means that 
we don't have any halo around the selection,

03:50: so the deselected bull is not 
bleeding into the selected background.

03:56: If we wanted to change that, I could crank 
that value up to 100%, and notice now the horn,

04:02: for example, the deselected horn, is bleeding 
outward; the blur is actually bleeding outward

04:06: into the background.

04:08: So the Blur Gallery is taking 
the deselected area into account.

04:12: As I say, that's the way it works with 
Gaussian blur, and with just about every other filter

04:17: inside of Photoshop, but 
the Blur Gallery is special.

04:19: Anyway, I don't want that much selection bleed;
I just want a little, so I am going to take

04:23: this value down to 35%.

04:26: Then we'll go down to the Blur Effects here. 
Notice that the Bokeh is turned on; however,

04:30: the values have reset to their defaults.
At least that's what you should see.

04:34: I am going to go ahead and turn Bokeh off, 
because I don't want it for this specific effect.

04:38: Then I'll go up to the top of the window and 
click on OK in order to apply that blur to

04:43: the selected layer.

04:45: All right, we'll finish this project in 
the next movie when we discuss Iris Blur,

04:49: but in the meantime, I'm going to switch to 
another image. Let's say I want to blur this

04:53: background, which is separated from the glasses 
by the way, so we've just got this beach in

04:58: the background, as you can see

04:59: if I Alt+Click or Option+Click on the eye 
in front of the beach layer. I'll Alt+Click

05:03: or Option+Click again. I am going to press 
Ctrl+J or Command+J on the Mac to make a copy

05:07: of this layer, and then I'll switch over to 
the Channels panel, and notice I have this

05:12: alpha channel that contains a gradient.

05:14: So it's going to protect the bottom portion 
of the beach, and it's going to reveal the

05:17: waves and the entire background and 
make that available for blurring.

05:22: So I'll press the Ctrl key or the Command 
key on a Mac and click on that channel to

05:26: load it up as a selection outline.

05:27: Then I'll switch back to the RGB image, return 
to the Layers panel, and then press Ctrl+Alt+F

05:33: or Command+Option+F on the Mac in order 
to reload the last settings applied.

05:38: And this is really interesting. Notice now 
that we can't see the pins, but we can see

05:42: the marching ants, which is great.

05:43: Now I'll press Ctrl+H ,and it reverses, so 
you don't see the marching ants anymore--we

05:47: wouldn't want to see those--but we can't 
see the pins, which is pretty darn useful.

05:51: Then go up to the Options bar here and click 
Remove all pins, so that we can start over.

05:56: And I'm going to click to set a pin right 
at this location there. And a Blur value of

06:00: 15 pixels is a little high for this effect,
so I am going to take it down to 10.

06:04: And notice what's happening here: if you look 
closely, you'll see that the blur is not so

06:08: much unblurring--in other words the landscape 
is not coming into focus as it comes toward

06:13: us; instead, the blur is just becoming more 
translucent, which really doesn't make that much sense.

06:18: Two ways to deal with that. One is to go up 
to the Selection Bleed and let's crank that

06:22: up to 100, so we are bleeding as much of the 
deselected area into the selection as possible.

06:28: And the other thing you want 
to do is set another pin.

06:31: So I am going to click down here at the 
bottom of the image, and I'll drag inside the ring

06:34: until my Blur value is 5 pixels.

06:36: All right, now I'll click OK in order to accept 
that modification. Wait for the Progress Bar

06:41: if it comes up. Then what I want you to do, 
because I actually want the entire background

06:46: to be slightly blurred, I'll press Ctrl+D or 
Command+D on a Mac to deselect the image.

06:51: I'll press Ctrl+Alt+F or Command+Option+F on the 
Mac in order to bring back up my last settings.

06:57: This guy remains selected, as you can see there,
so I'll just press the Backspace key or the

07:01: Delete key on a Mac to get rid of it.

07:03: Then I'll select this other pin, and I am going to 
take the Blur value this time down to just 3 pixels.

07:09: And so in other words, we're heaping 
one field blur on top of another.

07:13: This one is very simple. It doesn't have a 
selection. We're not adding multiple pins. Just click

07:17: OK in order to apply that final effect.

07:21: And that's how you take advantage of the 
Selection Bleed option, available to all three filters

07:26: included in the Blur Gallery.


 ** Creating a radial blur with Iris Blur

00:00: In this movie, I am going to show you how 
to use the next filter in the Blur Gallery,

00:04: which is Iris Blur, and along the way, we 
are going to turn this version of the Wall

00:08: Street Bull into this final composition.

00:11: So if you're working along with me, make sure 
to press Ctrl+D or Command+D on a Mac so that

00:15: the entire image is deselected.

00:18: Switch back to Wall Street Bull layer, press 
Ctrl+A or Command+A on the Mac to select the

00:22: entire thing, and then press Ctrl+Alt+J or 
Command+Option+J to jump in to a new layer.

00:28: And I'm going to name this layer "bull" and 
then press the Enter key or the Return key

00:31: on the Mac and drag the bull 
layer above the backdrop layer.

00:35: All right, now let's load that selection again, 
by switching to the Channels panel and pressing

00:39: the Ctrl key or the Command key on a Mac 
and clicking on that refine edge channel.

00:44: Notice, by the way, that this channel has a 
keyboard shortcut of Ctrl+7 or Command+7 on the Mac.

00:49: Another way to load the selection outline 
would be to add the Alt or Option key, so

00:53: you could press Ctrl+Alt+7 or 
Command+Option+7 on the Mac.

00:57: Now switch back to the Layers panel and then go 
up to the Filter menu, choose Blur, and choose

01:03: Iris Blur to bring up the Blur Gallery.

01:06: Now, the idea behind the Iris Blur is that you 
have the central portion of focus right there.

01:11: So the pin this time represents the area of 
the image that is in focus. I am going to

01:15: move it to the center of the bull's face.

01:17: I'm also going to drop the Blur value down 
to 10 pixels, and that determines how blurry

01:23: everything outside of this 
elliptical perimeter becomes.

01:28: These points right there--notice them, these 
white dots--they represent the area that is

01:33: in focus. So this entire area right here 
remains in focus, and then the focus declines between

01:40: the dots and the perimeter of the ellipse.

01:42: I am going to make the ellipse bigger all 
the way around, by dragging directly on that

01:46: ellipse, and then if you want to change the shape of 
the ellipse, you drag on one of these square points.

01:52: So I am going to drag on this one here in 
order to make the ellipse wider, like so.

01:56: And I am also going to drag up on the one at the 
bottom to make the ellipse a little bit shorter.

02:01: If you want to change the angle of the ellipse, 
move your cursor slightly beyond that point.

02:05: In my case, I have got my cursor just to the right 
of the ellipse, and I will drag upward, like so.

02:11: You can also change the roundness of the 
ellipse by dragging on this diamond right here in

02:16: the upper-right region. And so I am going to 
drag it out so that I have more of a rounded-

02:21: corner rectangle, as opposed to, 
strictly speaking, an ellipse.

02:26: Now if you want to change the size of the 
area that's in focus, you drag one of these

02:29: white circles. And I'm going to drag it inward 
like so, to about this location, so that the

02:35: lowest circle is below the animal's chin. 
You can also move each one of the dots independently

02:40: by Alt or Option dragging it.

02:43: So I will go ahead and Alt+Drag or Option+Drag 
this one to the animal's rib cage right there.

02:47: I'll Alt+Drag or Option+Drag the left circle 
over to the bull's shoulder, and then I will

02:53: Alt+Drag or Option+Drag the top 
circle to just above his head.

02:57: So this area now, this entire region there 
that I am tracing, becomes the area that's

03:01: in focus, and then the other stuff gradually 
declines in focus, all the way to that rounded

03:06: corner perimeter.

03:08: All right, now I am going to change the selection 
bleed. It's not going to make a huge difference,

03:11: but I am going to go ahead and raise it to its 
maximum setting of 100% so the area outside

03:17: of the bull is bleeding into 
the hooves and into the horn.

03:21: All right, so that should do it.

03:23: Now I don't want any kind of bokeh, so I 
am going to turn that checkbox off and then

03:27: I will click OK in order to apply my change.

03:30: Now, I want to mask my bull, so I'll drop down 
to the Add Layer Mask icon and I will click

03:34: on it, and that will convert the 
selection outline into a layer mask.

03:39: Now I want to add a little bit of a glow, 
so I will drop down to that original Smart

03:42: Object once again.

03:43: I will press Ctrl+A or Command+A on the Mac, 
and I will press Ctrl+Alt+J or Command+Option+J

03:47: on the Mac and call this new layer glow, and 
then I will drag it to above the bull layer.

03:54: This time we don't need a selection, so I 
will just press Ctrl+Alt+F or Command+Option+F

03:59: on the Mac to bring back up my last settings. 
And the only change I want to make is to add some bokeh.

04:05: So I am going to turn on the Bokeh checkbox, 
and I am going to change the Light Bokeh setting

04:09: to 25%, and I'll take the Bokeh Color value 
up to 100%. And finally, I will reduce that

04:16: first light range value to 30, and I will 
take the last Light Range value down to 215, in

04:21: order to create this effect here.

04:23: Now, in the case of this layer, I want everything 
to be slightly blurred, so right now the area

04:27: beyond the rounded-rectangle 
perimeter has a Blur Radius of 10 pixels.

04:32: I am going to go up to this Focus value right 
there and reduce it to 50% so that we have

04:38: the equivalent of 10 divided by two, that 
is, five pixels' worth of blur right there in

04:43: the center. And now I will click OK 
in order to accept a modification.

04:48: Now we need to convert this layer into a glow, 
and I'll do that by going to the Blend Mode

04:52: pop-up menu here in the upper-left corner 
of the Layers panel, and I will change the

04:56: mode from Normal to Soft Light, and we 
will end up achieving this effect here.

05:00: Now, we're getting too much contrast out of 
the effect, so we need to reduce the contrast

05:05: of all the layers below the glow layer by 
clicking on the bull layer. And then you want

05:10: to press the Alt key or the Option key on the 
Mac, click the black/white icon, and choose

05:14: Levels--or if you loaded DekeKeys, you could just 
press Ctrl+Shift+L or Command+Shift+L on the Mac.

05:19: I will go ahead and call this new layer 
"low contrast" and then press the Enter key or the

05:24: Return key on the Mac.

05:25: And I am going to select that first Output 
levels value and press Shift+Up Arrow three

05:29: times in a row to change the value to 30. 
Then I will tab to the second value and press

05:35: Shift+Down Arrow four times in a row to 
reduce it to 215. And then finally, I'll Shift+Tab

05:41: my way back to the Gamma value and I will 
press Shift+Up Arrow in order to change it

05:46: to 1.1, and now I will go ahead 
and hide the Properties panel.

05:49: All right, now I have gone ahead and created 
a couple of adjustment layers in advance.

05:53: The first is this layer called B&W, which is a 
Channel Mixer layer. And if I double-click

05:58: on the layers thumbnail, you can 
see the values that I have entered.

06:02: So I have gone ahead and turned on the Monochrome 
checkbox of course, because I want a black-and-white image.

06:06: The I set Red to 42, Green to 50, Blue to 
20, and it's a total of 112, which I have to

06:12: work out where the histogram is concerned, 
and then just make sure I add some nice rich

06:16: blacks, I took the Constant value down to -2.

06:18: Next, we have got this Gradient Map layer. 
I will go ahead and turn it on and select

06:23: the layer. And this gradient, by the way, is a 
variation of one of those gradients I created

06:28: for you a few chapters back, 
specifically the gradient called Plate finish.

06:32: All right, I will go ahead and hide the 
Properties panel and that is the final version of the

06:36: effect, folks. And just to see how far we've 
come, I will go ahead and scroll down my Layers

06:40: panel and Alt+Click or Option+Click on the 
eyeball in front of the Wall Street Bull layer.

06:45: So this is the original version of the image 
and if I Alt+Click or Option+Click again,

06:49: this is the final composition,

06:51: thanks to a combination of Field Blur and 
Iris Blur working together here inside Photoshop.


 ** Creating "fake miniatures" with Tilt-Shift

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to apply the 
final blur gallery filter, which is Tilt Blur.

00:05: Like Iris Blur, Tilt Blur allows you 
to create gradual-focus transitions.

00:09: However, they are linear 
transitions as opposed to radial.

00:13: And among other things, you can 
create fake miniature effects.

00:16: So in our case, we are going to take this 
bustling street scene and we are going to

00:19: turn it into this thriving little tiny town.

00:22: So, switch back to my image at hand.

00:25: And notice that I have converted the 
image to a Smart Object and then I applied trio

00:29: of Smart Filters.

00:30: I'll go ahead and turn the Smart Filters on, 
so you can see. First I applied a big helping

00:34: of Reduced Noise, and I'll just go ahead and double 
click on Reduce Noise so we can see the values.

00:39: I set the Strength to 10, both Preserve 
Details and Reduce Color Noise is set to zero, and

00:44: then I actually cranked up Sharpen Details to 
75% because, as opposed to trying to correct

00:50: the image, I'm trying to achieve an effect.

00:52: Then click OK. And the idea here is we are 
trying to turn these people into little toys,

00:57: essentially, that are made out of plastic. 
Then I applied Median with a radius of two

01:01: pixels and finally, I added a dollop of Smart 
Sharpen, at 200%, with a radius of one pixel,

01:09: and Remove set to Gaussian Blur. All right!

01:11: Let's take that layer and make a copy of it 
by pressing Ctrl+A or Command+A on the Mac,

01:16: and then press Ctrl+Alt+J or Command+Option+J 
on the Mac and call this layer Tilt Blur, and

01:22: then press Enter or Return.

01:23: Next, go up to the Filter menu, 
choose Blur, and then choose Tilt-Shift.

01:28: And you can see that we now 
have this linear transition.

01:31: So the idea here is the pin represents the 
point of focus. And I'll go ahead and move

01:36: that point of focus onto the front of the 
bus. And then these first lines represent

01:42: the area that will remain in focus, and then 
the dotted lines represent the area that's

01:47: out of focus. And of course beyond the 
dotted outline, we have the lower focus, which by

01:52: default is a blur radius of 15 pixels. 
The area between the solid line and the dotted

01:57: line gradually declines in focus.

02:00: Now if you want to change the angle of your 
Tilt-Shift, you could just go ahead and drag

02:04: on that white circle like so, and you will 
see the angle in that little heads up display,

02:08: and you can also drag the circle in 
order to move that line of focus there.

02:12: But if you want a little more control, 
because you can see that you end up making pretty

02:16: big changes very quickly when you drag on the 
circle, another way to work--I'll go ahead

02:20: and press Ctrl+Z or Command+Z on the Mac 
to undo that change--is to click and drag.

02:26: So as opposed to just clicking, which will 
set another pin--we don't want that, so I'll

02:30: press the Backspace key or the Delete key 
on the Mac, and then once again click on the

02:34: pin inside the bus--

02:36: you can drag farther away from the center 
point like so, and that's going to give you

02:40: a lot more control over the rotation.

02:42: Now, in my case, I don't want any rotation, 
so I'll press Ctrl+Z or Command+Z on the Mac.

02:47: And I'm going to drag this circle down, like 
so, and I'm pressing the Shift key in order

02:52: to constrain the angle of my drag to exactly 
vertical. And I am going to drag it to the

02:57: top of the face of the bus there.

02:59: And then I'm going to drag the one below while 
pressing the Shift key to the bottom of the

03:03: face of that bus, so just the 
bus face is entirely in focus.

03:07: And then I am going to drag this top line 
up. You don't need to press the Shift key

03:11: this time around because we 
are not changing the angle.

03:13: And I'm looking for the dotted line to 
intersect the windshield of that cab right there.

03:19: And then I'll scroll down. And even though 
that lower dotted outline appears outside

03:23: the canvas, you can still drag it 
to a new location. All right!

03:26: I'll just go ahead and reset my view by 
pressing Ctrl+0, Command+0 on the Mac.

03:31: In addition to the Blur value, you have this 
Distortion value, and we are going to get a

03:35: better sense of how Distortion 
works if we increase the Blur.

03:38: So I'll take it not quite that high, maybe 
to something like 30 for now. And now I'll

03:42: turn on Symmetrical Distortion, because otherwise you 
are just going to get a distortion in the foreground.

03:47: If you turn on Symmetrical Distortion, you will get a 
distortion in the foreground and the background.

03:52: And now I'll go ahead and reduce the Distortion 
value, and you can see that the blur is distorting

03:56: from up-left to down-right; and then if I increase 
the Distortion value, it goes in the opposite

04:02: diagonal direction.

04:03: In my case, I want a distortion of about 20%. 
And I'll then Shift+Tab to the Blur value

04:09: and take it back down to 
15 pixels. All right!

04:12: So assuming that I like my effect, I'll go 
ahead and click OK in order to accept my changes,

04:18: and I ultimately achieve 
this version of my tiny town.

04:21: So that's how you use the Tilt-Shift filter 
inside Photoshop, but let's imagine that you

04:25: want to create some more points of focus inside 
this image. Well, you can combine the various

04:29: blurs with each other, and I'll show you 
how to do exactly that in the next movie.


 ** Combining multiple Blur Gallery effects

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to combine multiple Blur 
Gallery filters together in order to achieve

00:05: still more sophisticated effects.

00:08: So let's say in my case I want the 
upper-right corner of my image to be blurrier or still,

00:12: and yet I want to make sure that 
this line right here remains in focus.

00:17: I might add a little bit of blur to this tree 
as well, and I'll do so by adding a Field Blur.

00:22: So assuming you just got done applying 
the Tilt Shift filter, here is what you do.

00:27: I'll switch back to that traffic layer,

00:29: press Ctrl+A or Command+A on a Mac, and then 
press Ctrl+Alt+J or Command+Option+J on the

00:34: Mac in order to create a pixel-based copy of 
that layer. And I'll call it "more blur" and

00:39: then I'll press the Enter key or the Return key on 
the Mac and drag it above the Tilt Blur layer.

00:44: Now I'll press Ctrl+Alt+F or Command+Option+F 
on the Mac to reinstate my last-applied filter

00:49: gallery settings, which is that Tilt Blur, and 
I'll go head and tilt open the Field Blur

00:55: in the Blur Tools panel, and that will 
automatically turn it on as well and give me a single pin right

01:00: there in the center.

01:02: I'm going to move that pin to the upper-right 
region of the image, and I'm going to increase

01:06: the radius by 20 by 
dragging clockwise on that ring.

01:09: Now that wipes out the 
focus of the entire image,

01:12: so I need to reinstate some 
focus with a couple more pins.

01:15: I'll click right there in the face of the 
bus to set a pin, and I'll reduce its Blur

01:19: value to 0. And I might go ahead and drag that pin 
over to the left-hand side of the face of the bus.

01:26: Then I'll click inside this little cab to add 
another pin, and I'll reduce its Blur Radius

01:30: to 0 pixels as well.

01:32: Now I want to blur the tree, so I'll go 
ahead and click right about there in the tree.

01:36: I don't want it to be that blurry,

01:38: so I'll reduce the Blur value to 5 pixels, and we 
end up with this final version of the effect.

01:44: Now, if you what you get says what that mask 
looks like after all these modifications,

01:49: you can tap the M key, and then you'll see 
the mask, and you will note that we have this

01:54: hot area of white in the upper right-hand 
corner. That represents the maximum blur value

01:58: we've assigned--0 pixels--and everywhere 
that we see the light gray, that represents

02:03: a decline in the blur.

02:05: So in this region for examples we've had a 
blur, of one would think, about 15 pixels.

02:10: Here is that tree.

02:11: So it's dark gray at 5 pixels, and then this line 
right here represents the area that remains in focus.

02:18: I'm going to set one more pin at this 
location and reduce its Blur value to 0 as well, so

02:24: that we have an 
uninterrupted line of high focus.

02:28: Now I'll tap the M key again in 
order to hide the mask.

02:31: Because it's such a nuanced mask, I'm going to go 
head and turn on the Save Masks to Channels checkbox,

02:36: because that's as close as you come to being 
able to save your settings from the Blur Gallery.

02:41: Hopefully, one day we will be 
able to save more than this,

02:44: but that's all we got for now.

02:45: I'm going to turnoff Bokeh checkbox just to 
make sure I'm not getting any Bokeh whatsoever,

02:50: and then I'll click OK in order to 
accept that final modification.

02:55: Now, let's take a look at what 
we've been able to come up with here.

02:57: I'm going to press the F key couple times 
to fill the screen with the image, and then

03:01: I'll go ahead and zoom in as well.

03:03: Just for the sake of comparison, here's the 
original unmodified version of that photograph,

03:08: and here's the image rendered as a fake 
miniature, with little metal cars and plastic people,

03:13: thanks to Tilt Shift and Field Blur 
working together here inside Photoshop.


 ** Blend Modes

00:00: The topic of this chapter is blend modes.

00:03: In case you haven't heard of them before, a 
blend mode uses some basic math -- plus, times,

00:09: minus, really easy stuff --

00:10: to blend the active layer with the ones below. 
I know; I'm already making it sound hard, but it's not.

00:17: You know opacity, right?

00:19: If you set a layer to, say, 75% opacity, that 
means you see 75% of it, and 25% of the layers

00:27: below. So simple.

00:30: Blend modes just use different formulas.

00:32: Let's say that you multiply a layer.

00:34: That means you take the luminance levels from 
the active layer, and multiply them by those

00:40: of the layers below,

00:41: which means you put this 
layer on top of this one,

00:45: set the arm wrestlers to Multiply, and bang!

00:48: The active layer becomes a transparent overlay resting 
on top of, and thereby darkening, the layer below.

00:55: Once you get it, you'll use it all the time.

00:57: Seriously, you and multiply are going to 
be best friends in just a few movies.

01:03: But don't get too chummy, because you know, 
there are more than 25 of these things.

01:07: You don't need to know all of them; 
maybe a dozen are of any use.

01:11: But just for safety's sake, I'm going to 
show you every blend mode there is.


 ** Using the Dissolve mode

00:00: All right, gang. So as I mentioned, Normal, the item 
at the top of the blend mode pop-up menu, and the

00:05: default setting here at the top of the Layers 
panel; that's the equivalent of having the

00:09: blend mode turned off, which makes 
Dissolve the first true blend mode.

00:13: We'll be examining how Dissolve works, and 
exploring one possible use for Dissolve in this movie.

00:19: So I am going to switch over to this file.

00:21: We're going to take this white text right 
here, and we're going to turn it into this

00:24: kind of carving, as if the text 
were hand-burned into the sign.

00:28: So I will start things off by creating a 
new layer that I am going to create above

00:33: the sign layer, and below go away layer. I 
will press Control+Shift+N, or Command+Shift+N

00:37: on the Mac, and I will go ahead and call this layer 
black, because ultimately that will be its purpose.

00:42: But we're going to start things 
off by filling it with a circle.

00:46: So if you've got your Rectangular Marquee 
tool selected, you can press Shift+M in order

00:50: to switch to the Elliptical Marquee, and I 
am going to drag from some place toward the

00:54: center of this signpost, and I will press the 
Shift+Alt keys, or the Shift+Option keys on

00:59: the Mac, to draw from the center outward, as 
well as constrain the shape to a circle.

01:04: Then once I've drawn the shape, I will press the 
D key to make sure that black is my foreground

01:08: color, and I will press Alt+Backspace or Option+
Delete to fill the circle with black. All right!

01:12: Now I will click off the circle to deselect it,
and then I will go up to the Filter menu,

01:17: choose Blur, and choose Gaussian Blur, or if 
you loaded DekeKeys, then you can press Shift+F6.

01:23: And I am going to enter this huge 
Radius value of 100 pixels, and click OK.

01:28: So when we're working with Normal, and the 
Opacity level is set to 100%, then the central

01:33: portion of the shape is 100% opaque.

01:36: It drifts away, thanks to the fuzzy edges 
that we created using Gaussian Blur, to complete

01:41: transparency, so 0% opacity, and it goes and drifts 
through all the levels of translucency in between.

01:46: Now, if I were to, say, press the 5 key to reduce 
the Opacity setting in the upper right corner

01:51: of the Layers panel to 50%, then the most 
opaque pixels at the center of the circle

01:56: will be 50% opaque, and then, of course, they drift 
off to transparency, just as before. All right.

02:02: I am going to press 0 to 
reestablish an opacity level of 100%,

02:06: and then I will go ahead and click on the 
word Normal here to bring up the blend mode

02:10: pop-up menu, and I will change 
the blend mode to Dissolve.

02:14: And notice what we get instead. I'll go 
ahead and zoom in on my text, and I will scroll

02:17: over a little bit as well.

02:19: So wherever the circle is 100% opaque, we 
have absolutely opaque pixels. Anywhere where

02:24: it's 100% transparent, such as up 
here in the upper left corner,

02:28: we don't see any pixels at all.

02:30: In between, we see varying levels of pixels.

02:33: So for example, let's imagine this 
area here is roughly 50% opaque.

02:38: In that case, half the pixels will be turned on, and 
the other half of the pixels will be turned off.

02:44: As the pixels grow more translucent, we'll 
see fewer and fewer of them. As they grow

02:49: more opaque, we'll see more and more of them.

02:52: So instead of having translucent pixels, we now 
have pixels either turned on, or turned off.

02:57: And so the result is a kind of 
poor man's airbrushing effect.

03:01: Notice if I press the 5 key to reduce the 
Opacity of the circle to 50%, then at most

03:06: we're seeing half the pixels turned on, and 
then fewer and fewer are turned on, until

03:11: we see absolute transparency in the 
upper left corner, for example. All right!

03:15: I will go ahead and press Control+D, or 
Command+D on the Mac, to deselect the image.

03:18: I will also go ahead and turn off 
this black layer for the moment.

03:22: We'll come back to it later.

03:23: So I will be honest with you; Dither is not 
a blend mode that I use very often, but it

03:27: can sometimes come in handy.

03:29: For example, let's say I want to take these 
hand-drawn letters right there, and I want

03:33: to give them some texturized edges in order 
to achieve this effect here. I will go

03:37: ahead and zoom in on these letters, so 
that we can see what I am talking about.

03:42: Notice, if you examine the outlines of these 
characters, you can see that they're actually

03:46: etched into the grains of wood, and that's 
an effect that we can achieve, at least in

03:51: part, with Dissolve.

03:53: So I will go ahead and 
switch back to my starter image.

03:55: And not only can you apply Dissolve as a 
blend mode here inside the Layers panel, but you

03:59: can also apply it to any of the layer effects.

04:02: So, let's say I want to soften these letters 
using that drop shadow trick that I showed

04:06: you back in Chapter 16 of 
the intermediate course.

04:10: The first thing I do is make the text 
invisible by setting the Fill value to 0%, and I can

04:15: achieve that from the keyboard 
just by pressing Shift+0+0.

04:19: Now I'll drop down to the fx icon, and I 
will choose Drop Shadow, and I will start

04:24: by switching the drop shadow color from black to white, 
because we want white text to pull off this effect.

04:30: I will set the Opacity to 100%, I will change 
the blend mode, for now, to Normal, and I will

04:36: reduce the Distance value to 0, and I'll take 
the Size value up to 10 pixels, and then I

04:41: will turn off the Layer Knocks Out Drop Shadow 
layer in order to achieve this effect here.

04:46: Now let's turn those soft edges around the 
text into dithered edges by switching the

04:52: blend mode from Normal to Dissolve, 
and we end up with this dot pattern.

04:56: Now, if you want more dots, then you 
can raise the Size value, like so.

05:01: If you want fewer dots around those edges,
then you can reduce the Size value.

05:05: And notice, even if I take the Size value 
down to 0 pixels, we're going to get a little

05:10: bit of ratty edge action.

05:12: Anyway, as I say, I came up with a size value 
of 10 pixels, and then I went ahead and clicked

05:17: OK in order to accept that effect. All right!

05:20: Next, I am going to press Control+0 or Command+0 
on the Mac to back out, turn my black layer

05:25: back on, and I'll change it 
back to the Normal mode.

05:28: And incidentally, you've got a keyboard 
shortcut for nearly all of the blend modes.

05:32: As long as the Selection tool is active, you 
can press Shift+Alt, or on the Mac, Shift+Option,

05:38: along with a letter key.

05:39: So for Normal, it's Shift+Alt+N, 
or Shift+Option+N on the Mac.

05:44: Then I press 0 to reinstate the Opacity to 100%, 
and then I press Alt+Backspace, or Option+Delete

05:50: on the Mac, to fill that entire 
layer with black, hence its name.

05:55: Now we need to go ahead and convert what 
we're seeing onscreen to a selection outline.

05:59: So switch over to the Channels panel, and 
press the Control key, or the Command key on a Mac,

06:04: and click on any of these items.

06:06: I went ahead and Control+Clicked 
or Command+Clicked on RGB,

06:10: and what that does is it selects all the white 
stuff, and deselects the black stuff. So we're 
`

06:14: selecting the letters, in other words.

06:15: Now I will switch back to Layers panel, click 
on this sign layer right there, and I am going

06:21: to press the Alt key, or the Option key on 
the Mac, and drag the sign thumbnail up to

06:25: the top of the stack in order 
to create a duplicate, like so.

06:29: Now I will go ahead and turn off the go away, and 
black layers, because we don't need them anymore.

06:35: Go over here to layer Mask thumbnail for the 
top sign layer, right-click on it, and choose

06:39: Delete Layer Mask, because that's not the 
mask we're looking for this time around, and

06:43: then drop down to the Add Layer Mask icon, 
and click on it in order to mask the sign

06:49: inside the letters. All right!

06:51: Now at this point we can't see any difference 
between the letters and the sign, because they're

06:54: the same, so let's go ahead and differentiate 
the letters by adding a few layer effects.

06:59: So I will drop down to the fx icon, 
and I will choose Inner Shadow.

07:02: I will click on the Color Swatch, and I am 
going to dial in a Hue value of 30, Saturation

07:07: 100, and Brightness of 25, and then I will go 
ahead and change the blend mode from Multiply

07:13: to Linear Burn, and I'll explain how 
both of these modes work in later movies,

07:18: but for now, just go ahead and do it, and 
then I will reduce the Opacity value to 50%.

07:22: I am going to take the Distance value up to 
15 pixels, and the Size value to 25 pixels,

07:28: Choke is set to 0.

07:30: Then switch to Color Overlay, click on its 
color swatch, and I am going to dial in a

07:34: Hue of 30 once again, Saturation of 75, and 
the Brightness of 35; click OK. Change the

07:41: blend mode to Hard Light, one of the big contrast modes;
we'll see how it works in a later movie as well.

07:47: And then I will take the 
Opacity value down to 40%.

07:50: And finally, I'm going to 
add a dark outer glow,

07:53: so I will click on the Outer Glow.

07:54: I will change its blend mode to Linear Burn, 
and then I'll click on the white color swatch --

07:59: it may be yellow in your case -- and I'll 
change the Hue value to 30 degrees.

08:03: I will take the Saturation up to 100%, and I 
will change the Brightness to 25%, click

08:08: OK, take the Opacity down to 55%, and then 
I am going to take the Size value down to

08:14: a mere 2 pixels, then click OK. All right;

08:17: let's go ahead and zoom in on this text.

08:19: Now, this wood should technically sort of 
go down a little bit as it gets exposed,

08:24: so I'm going to turn off the link between 
the sign and this layer mask by clicking

08:30: on that little chain icon.

08:31: Then I will click on the sign's thumbnail 
there in the Layers panel, and I will press

08:35: Control+Down Arrow or Command+Down Arrow five times in 
a row in order to make the grains go downward.

08:40: Now we need to roughen up those edges, because 
if you zoom in, you can see that they're pretty

08:46: garbagy right now. A lot of loose 
pixels; doesn't look right at all.

08:49: So I'll click on the layer mask thumbnail 
to make it active, go up to the Filter menu,

08:54: choose Blur, and choose Motion Blur.

08:57: And I came up with these settings right here; 
an angle of -3 degrees, because there's not

09:01: much of a pitch to these lines.

09:04: And then I set the Distance value to 5 pixels, and 
that helped me achieve this effect here, click OK.

09:09: I wanted to sharpen up things just a little 
bit, so then I went to the Filter menu, chose

09:14: Sharpen, and chose Smart Sharpen. Make sure, 
by the way, that your layer mask, and not your

09:20: image, is selected.

09:22: And I came up with these values here: an Amount 
of 100%, Radius of 1.0 pixel, and Remove set

09:27: to Lens Blur. Click OK, and we end up with 
this final effect, with these character outlines

09:33: that are actually matching the 
texture of the woodgrain. All right;

09:36: I will go ahead and press the F key a couple 
of times in order to fill the screen with

09:40: the image, and this is my final effect, 
achieved in part using the Dissolve blend mode.


 ** Multiply and the darken modes

00:00: In this movie, I'll demonstrate how to work 
with the second group of blend modes in the

00:04: blend mode pop-up menu, and these include 
Darken through Darker Color, and they are known as

00:09: the darken modes.

00:11: And the reason is that they turn everything 
on the active layer into darkness, which is

00:16: why they're also known as the shadow mode, 
because they effectively turn the layer into

00:20: a shadow that's being cast 
onto the rest of the image.

00:24: Even very bright colors in the active layer 
will create darkness, by the way, with the

00:28: exception of one color: white.

00:31: If the active layer contains white pixels,
then those pixels become transparent.

00:37: So let's see how they work.

00:38: I've got this background image, which is a 
photograph of some parchment from the Fotolia

00:42: Image Library, about which you can 
learn more at Fotolia.com/Deke.

00:46: I'm going to turn on this gradient layer, 
and click on it as well to make it active.

00:51: So if you're looking at this image along with me,
this is a radial gradient that's positioned

00:55: near the top of the artwork.

00:57: Notice, by the way, that the gradient starts 
white in the center, and becomes black around

01:01: the perimeter of the canvas.

01:03: If I want to turn everything on this layer 
into a darkening agent, then I can switch

01:08: from Normal to any of the 
darken modes, starting with Darken.

01:13: And what the Darken mode does is it keeps 
the darkest pixel -- either on the active layer,

01:19: or the composite version of all the 
layers below -- on a channel by channel basis.

01:24: So if I switch over to the Channels panel, 
and click on Red, you'll see that some of

01:28: the parchment is showing through, because it's 
darker, but most of the gradient is visible,

01:33: because in the Red channel, mostly the gradient 
is darker, whereas if we switch to the Green

01:39: channel, then we get more parchment 
details, because those pixels are darker.

01:44: Anywhere where we're not seeing a spot of 
parchment, then that means the respective

01:47: gradient pixel is darker.

01:49: And then if I switch to Blue, we get a lot 
more parchment, because the parchment is pretty

01:53: dark in the Blue channel.

01:56: Then when you switch to Red, you get an 
amalgam of everything mixed together.

02:00: I'll go ahead and switch back to the Layers 
panel here, and I'll tell you that Darken,

02:04: even though it's called Darken, is 
one of the lesser darkening modes.

02:07: You're not going to find 
yourself using it very often.

02:09: I will show you one use, 
however, before this movie is out.

02:13: The better mode is the next mode 
down the list, which is Multiply.

02:17: And by the way, in addition to selecting Multiply 
from the menu, I'll show you a keyboard trick here.

02:23: If you want to advance from one mode to the 
other, first of all, if you're working on

02:26: a PC, make sure to press the Escape key, so 
the blend mode menu is not active. And then,

02:32: whether Mac or PC, as long as one of the 
Selection tools is active, you can press Shift+Plus

02:38: in order to advance to 
the next mode in the list.

02:40: If you want to back up, you press Shift+Minus.

02:43: Anyway, I'll press Shift+Plus 
to advance to Multiply.

02:46: This is not only a much better mode than Darken, but 
also the most practical of all the darken modes.

02:52: And what it does is it creates nice, organic, 
smooth transitions without any color enhancement.

02:59: So it's strictly a luminance adjustment.

03:01: And notice what happens here is the darkest 
colors in the gradient provide the most darkness,

03:07: while the lighter colors darken less.

03:09: And then finally, white doesn't 
darken at all; white just goes invisible.

03:14: But the result is that we have an absolutely 
smooth transition from black to parchment.

03:19: Now, if that's too much darkening, 
you can back off the Opacity value.

03:23: For example, I could press the 7 
key to reduce the Opacity to 70%.

03:27: I'll go ahead and press 0 to 
reset the Opacity to 100.

03:31: If that's not enough darkening, then you can 
advance to one of the two next modes; either

03:36: Color Burn, or Linear Burn.

03:38: I'll go ahead and press Shift+Plus in order 
to advance to Color Burn, and you can see,

03:43: not only do we get a higher contrast 
effect, but we also get enhanced saturation.

03:48: So Color Burn tends to increase 
the saturation dramatically.

03:52: It also results in a lot of noise 
inside of your image, just so you know.

03:57: If you want less saturation, as well as less 
noise, but you still want all of the contrast,

04:03: then you advance to the next blend mode, which 
is Linear Burn. And that is, in my opinion,

04:08: the second to best darken 
mode inside Photoshop.

04:11: Let me go ahead and compare Multiply 
to Linear Burn by doing the following.

04:15: As I was telling you in a previous movie, 
you can get to a blend mode by pressing the

04:19: Shift+Alt key, or Shift+Option on 
the Mac, along with a letter.

04:23: In the case of Multiply, you press Shift+Alt+M, 
or Shift+Option+M on the Mac. That's Multiply.

04:29: Then to switch back to Linear Burn, I will just go 
ahead and press Control+Z or Command+Z on the Mac.

04:34: So you can see, higher contrast effect, a 
little bit of saturation enhancement as well, and

04:40: a very powerful effect indeed.

04:42: Now if I press Shift+Plus, we'll advance 
to the final darken mode, which is Darker

04:46: Color, which just goes ahead and keeps 
the darkest pixel on a composite basis.

04:51: So we're seeing these very jagged transitions 
between the darker colors in the parchment

04:55: layer, and the darker 
colors on the gradient layer.

04:59: I will go so far as to say I have never found 
a use for this blend mode, and it is really,

05:04: honestly the least of the darken modes.

05:06: All right, I'm going to press Shift+Alt+N, 
or Shift+Option+N on the Mac, to reset the

05:11: gradient layer to Normal mode, and 
I'll go ahead and turn it off here.

05:14: I want you to also see what 
happens with the brushstroke.

05:18: So I'll go ahead and select the 
brushstroke layer, as well as turn it on.

05:21: I'm going to go ahead and skip Darken, and 
Darker Colo,r and I'll press Shift+Alt+M, or

05:26: Shift+Option+M on the Mac, to switch to the 
Multiply mode. And you can see, just like that,

05:30: we've turned this blue 
brushstroke into a magic marker effect.

05:34: If you want a more colorful effect, you can 
press Shift+Plus to advance to Color Burn,

05:38: but in this specific case, we're dropping out a 
lot of the darkness, and we're creating some

05:42: jagged transitions, as well as some noise.

05:45: If you want a genuinely darker effect than Multiply, 
you press Shift+Plus again to advance to Linear Burn.

05:51: Again, for the sake of demonstration, I'll 
press Shift+Alt+M, or Shift+Option+M on the Mac.

05:57: That's the Multiply mode.

05:58: If I press Control+Z, 
that's the Linear Burn mode.

06:01: All right; I'm going to go 
ahead and turn that layer off.

06:04: I was telling you, I never use a Darker 
Color mode, and I only occasionally use Darken.

06:09: I'll go ahead and click on the 
wrestlers layer, and turn it on.

06:13: Just by way of example, here is 
an interesting use for Darken.

06:16: I'll take that wrestlers layer, and I'll go up 
to Layers panel flyout menu, and I'll choose

06:20: Convert to Smart Object, or if you loaded dekeKeys, you 
can press Control+Comma, or Command+Comma on the Mac.

06:25: And then I'll go up to the Filter menu, 
choose Blur, and choose Gaussian Blur.

06:29: And I'll go ahead and set the Radius 
value to 4 pixels, and then click OK.

06:34: Now, that ends up 
uniformly blurring the image.

06:37: If you want to turn this blur into a kind 
of edge effect, what you can do is go down

06:42: here to the Smart Filters.

06:43: I'm going to right-click on that filter mask, 
and delete it, just so I have a little more

06:47: room in my Layers panel

06:49: And then I'll double-click on the slider icon 
to the right of the words Gaussian Blur, and

06:54: I could go ahead and change the blend mode 
to Multiply -- which, I'm telling you, is your

06:58: when in doubt darken mode inside Photoshop -- 
but that's going to uniformly darken the image.

07:03: So it's going to use the blurry version of 
the image to darken the sharp version, and

07:09: we're going to end up losing a lot of detail.

07:11: However, if I set the blend mode to Darken 
instead, you can see that we're getting a

07:15: kind of dark edge effect.

07:17: That's most obvious here 
inside of the hands.

07:20: So we get some abrupt transitions here and 
there, but it can be interesting at times.

07:24: All right, I'll go ahead and 
click OK to accept the effect.

07:28: I don't want the blur; I 
just wanted to show you that.

07:30: So I'm going to turn the 
Gaussian Blur effect off.

07:33: And what I want to do, when everything is 
said and done, is I want to blend the wrestlers

07:38: into the background parchment.

07:39: So there is the parchment in the background.

07:41: There is the wrestler layer.

07:43: It's selected and waiting for me, so I'll go 
ahead and choose the Multiply mode in order

07:47: to darken one layer into the other.

07:50: If you want an analogy for how this works, 
imagine that we have the wrestlers printed

07:54: on one transparency, and we have the 
parchment printed on another transparency.

07:59: We lay them on top of each other on a 
light table, and this is the effect we'd get.

08:04: If that's not enough -- which it isn't in my 
case, I want a more powerful effect -- then

08:08: in most cases you're going to want to skip Color Burn,
and in this case, it's certainly nothing I want.

08:13: Instead, you'll go all the way to Linear Burn in 
order to create this very dramatic effect here.

08:20: And that's how you work with the five darken 
modes; in particular, Multiply, and if that

08:24: doesn't work, try Linear 
Burn, here inside Photoshop.


 ** Screen and the lighten modes

00:00: In this movie, I'll demonstrate 
the third group of blend modes.

00:03: These are the lighten modes, shown in red 
inside this slide, and every one of them uses the

00:07: active layer to brighten the contents of the 
layers below, which is why these are also

00:13: known as the glow modes.

00:15: Every single color on the active layer, even 
very dark colors, ends up darkening the colors

00:20: in the background, with the 
exception of one color: black.

00:24: If the active layer contains black 
pixels, those pixels become transparent.

00:29: Also worth noting is that there is a symmetry 
associated with the lighten modes, vis-à-vis

00:34: the darken modes.

00:35: So in other words, every single one of the 
lighten modes is an opposite of the darken

00:39: mode, and in the same order.

00:40: So Lighten is the opposite of Darken, Screen 
is the wonderful opposite of Multiply, Color

00:45: Dodge and Linear Dodge are the opposites of 
Color Burn and Linear Burn, and Lighter Color

00:51: is just as worthless as Darker Color.

00:54: So I'm going to switch to my composition in 
progress here, and I'm going to turn off the

00:57: wrestlers layer, scroll down to the bottom, 
and turn on this invert adjustment layer,

01:02: which turns our bright parchment dark, and 
also inverts the color scheme from a palette

01:07: of oranges to one of blues.

01:09: Now I'll click on the gradient 
layer, and turn it on as well.

01:12: So again, we have a radial gradient; 
white in the center, black on the outside.

01:17: If I switch the blend mode for this layer to 
Lighten, then I will keep just the brightest

01:21: pixels on a channel by channel basis.

01:24: So if we switch over to the Channels panel, 
you'll see that the inverted parchment is

01:28: very dark in that Red channel, and as a 
result, the gradient pixels tend to win.

01:33: If we switch to the Green channel, we see 
the parchment brightening up, and as a result,

01:38: we're getting more pixels from the 
parchment encroaching on the gradient.

01:42: Then finally, the inverted parchment is 
brightest in the Blue channel, and as a result, we're

01:46: seeing a lot of pixels from the parchment layer, 
along with fewer pixels in the gradient layer.

01:52: I'll go ahead and switch back to 
RGB, and return to the Layers panel.

01:57: That's all fine, but once again, we end 
up with some pretty choppy transitions.

02:00: If I want smoother transitions, I can press 
Shift+Plus in order to advance to the Screen

02:05: mode, and that takes our white to black gradient, 
and turns it into a radial glow, with no remnants

02:12: of darkening whatsoever.

02:14: Absolutely smooth, beautiful effect!

02:17: Now, if that's too timid for you, you can 
press Shift+Plus to advance to Color Dodge,

02:22: but as you can see, you're going to get some 
hyper-saturated colors, some very radical

02:27: luminance transitions, and you're going to 
get a lot of noise as well, which is why the

02:31: better way to brighten is to switch 
to the next mode: Linear Dodge (Add).

02:37: And it's so called, by the way, we're seeing 
Add in parentheses, because the mode really

02:41: does add the luminance levels of the active 
layer to those of the composite version of

02:47: the image below, which is why we end up 
blowing a lot of highlights in this case.

02:52: And I should mention, Linear Burn does the same 
thing, only opposite, so you could potentially

02:57: end up with a lot of clipped shadows.

02:59: And just to give you a sense of the difference 
between Screen and Linear Dodge, I'll go ahead

03:04: and press the Escape key, so the blend mode 
pop-up menu here on the PC is no longer active,

03:09: and I'll press the keyboard shortcut for the Screen mode,
which is Shift+Alt+S, or Shift+Option+S on the Mac.

03:15: So here's Screen; very smooth effect.

03:17: It doesn't enhance the saturation levels at 
all, strictly affects the luminance levels,

03:23: and if I press Control+Z or Command+Z on the Mac,
here, by contrast, is Linear Dodge, which

03:27: produces a higher contrast effect that 
potentially ends up clipping highlights.

03:32: Once again, something that the Screen mode 
cannot do; Screen never clips highlights,

03:37: and Multiply never clips shadows.

03:39: Then finally, if I press Shift+Plus to 
advance to the Lighter Color mode, we'll see that

03:43: we're either keeping pixels from the active 
layer, or from the composite layers in the

03:47: background on a pixel by pixel basis, and as a 
result, we unfailingly get jagged transitions.

03:53: All right, I'm going to go ahead 
and turn that gradient layer off.

03:57: Now let's see how these 
modes affect a brushstroke.

04:00: I'll go ahead and click in the 
brushstroke layer, turn it on as well.

04:03: The brushstroke is set to Linear Burn.

04:05: Let's go ahead and press Shift+Alt+N, or Shift+
Option+N on the Mac, to reset it to the Normal mode.

04:09: I also want to invert it, so I'll just press 
Control+I, or Command+I on the Mac, and that turns

04:14: that formerly bright blue 
brushstroke to a darker orange.

04:18: Now, because really no sense in checking out 
Lighten, or Lighter Color, I'll press Shift+Alt+S,

04:23: or Shift+Option+S on the Mac, to switch to 
the Screen mode, and you can see that we get

04:27: this kind of impossible 
highlighter effect, which is very cool.

04:31: Then I'll press Shift+Plus 
to advance to Color Dodge.

04:35: Most of the effect drops away.

04:36: We get some pretty ratty transitions.

04:39: And then I'll press Shift+Plus again to 
advance to Linear Dodge, which provides us with a

04:43: higher impact effect.

04:45: All right, I'm going to turn off brushstroke, 
and I'm going to scroll down to the stars

04:49: layer, and turn it on.

04:50: And you can see that this 
layer is already a Smart Object.

04:52: I want to show you that same Gaussian Blur 
trick that I showed you in a previous movie,

04:57: except this time combined with Lighten.

04:59: So because Gaussian Blur was the last filter I 
applied, it appears at the top of the Filter menu.

05:04: If I choose the command, because I'm working 
on a Smart Object, that brings up the Gaussian

05:08: Blur dialog box. A Radius of 4 is just fine.
Click OK in order to apply the filter,

05:14: and then double-click on the slider triangle 
to the right of the words Gaussian Blur, and

05:18: I'm going to change the mode 
this time to a brightening mode.

05:21: I could start with Screen, because it is your 
when in doubt mode, but that's going to give

05:25: us a very hot effect, because we're taking the 
entirety of the blurred image, and screening

05:30: it on top of the original.

05:33: However, if we choose Lighten instead, we're going 
to keep just these little glows; notice that.

05:38: I'll go ahead and zoom in 
here inside of the dialog box.

05:42: We have these glows around the outside of 
our synthetic stars, which I think is quite

05:47: a nice effect actually.

05:48: So I'll click OK in order to 
accept that modification,

05:51: and now I want to blend the stars into 
the background dark blue parchment.

05:55: So I'll start by pressing Shift+Alt+S, or Shift+
Option+S on the Mac, to assign the Screen mode to the

06:01: stars layer. And that's the way you 
work, by the way, with lighten modes;

06:05: you always start with Screen, see how it works 
out, and then my advice is, if Screen doesn't

06:10: deliver a sufficiently high impact effect, 
go ahead and switch to Linear Dodge (Add).

06:17: What that's done in the case of this image 
is create this kind of hole in the center

06:21: of the paper that's so bright,

06:24: the star is so very bright, that it's difficult to 
even look at, which is exactly the effect I want.

06:29: Now I'm going to turn the wrestlers layer 
back on, and click on that layer as well.

06:33: You can see that, because they're set to 
Linear Burn, they now appear too dark.

06:38: So I'm going to press the Escape key.

06:39: Do you see what I'm talking about?

06:40: There is a little blue highlight around the 
blend mode pop-up menu that prevents basically

06:45: all of your keyboard shortcuts from working, 
because Windows is focused on the pop-up menu.

06:50: And if this ever happens to you -- you try out a 
keyboard shortcut, and nothing happens -- just

06:54: try tapping on the Escape key. Even on the 
Mac this kind of stuff can happen, and tapping

07:00: the Escape key is oftentimes the solution.

07:03: Then I'll switch to the Multiply mode by 
pressing Shift+Alt+M or Shift+Option+M on the Mac.

07:09: And I want to mention one more thing.

07:10: I'm going to turn that wrestlers layer off 
for a moment, switch back to stars, and press

07:14: Shift+Alt+S, or Shift+Option+S on the Mac.

07:17: The reason the Multiply mode is called Multiply 
is because it actually multiplies the luminance

07:22: levels of pixels.

07:23: The reason Screen is called Screen is 
because of the analogy for how it works.

07:29: It's just like taking the stars, for example,
and the dark blue parchment, putting them

07:33: on, say, 35mm slides, putting those slides in 
separate projectors, and shining them both

07:40: at the same screen.

07:42: And that's why you end up 
getting this brightening effect.

07:45: Anyway, I'll go ahead and turn 
the wrestlers layer back on.

07:48: And I actually think I like this 
combination of Screen and Multiply better here.

07:52: A great thing about blend modes, of course, 
is that they're entirely nondestructive, and

07:56: you can change your mind anytime you like.

07:59: That's how you work with the lighten modes.

08:01: Remember to start with Screen, and if that 
doesn't give you the effect you're looking

08:05: for, try out Linear 
Dodge here inside Photoshop.


 ** Cleaning up and integrating a bad photo

00:00: In this movie, I will show you how to take 
some bad artwork that gets foisted on you,

00:04: for example, by a client, and then integrate 
it seamlessly with your wonderful composition

00:09: using a combination of 
darken and lighten blend modes.

00:13: So let's say, for example, that we are looking 
at that comp that I created at the end of

00:17: the movie before last, and my client wants 
me to take this light bulb, not some other

00:22: light bulb, but this light bulb that's this 
piece of line art that they printed out.

00:26: They hired a guy to draw some Sharpie lines 
on it, and then they didn't even scan it;

00:30: they took a digital photo, and applied 
as much JPEG compression as possible.

00:35: And I'm supposed to integrate it into my 
composition in order to create this seamless effect here.

00:40: Thanks to blend modes, 
the answer is, no problem.

00:44: So I am going to go ahead and 
switch back to this image.

00:46: So first thing that we need to do is get 
rid of all these weird aberrant colors.

00:49: So I am going to go up to the Image menu, 
choose Mode, and just choose Grayscale.

00:52: I don't need to create a custom mix.

00:54: I will get that alert message; I 
will click on the Discard button.

00:58: Now we have a Grayscale image.

00:59: The next step is to increase the Contrast, 
and I am just going to do that using a static

01:03: adjustment, so I will press Control+L, or Command+L 
on the Mac, to bring up the Levels dialog box.

01:09: And then I could grab the white Eyedropper 
tool, and then click somewhere in what should

01:12: be page white in order to clip that 
background to white. And that's not quite enough,

01:17: so I will try clicking at this location instead here. And 
I am still seeing some noise around the light bulb,

01:22: so I am going to take that white point value 
down to 90, let's say, and then I will increase

01:27: the black point value to 20.

01:29: I figured that works pretty good for this 
image, and then finally I'll click in the

01:33: gamma value, and press Shift+down arrow a 
couple of times in order to take that middle value

01:38: down to 0.8, and I will click OK.

01:41: Now we need to get rid of all the folderol 
around the light bulb, and I am going to do

01:45: that by first confirming that I've got white, 
and only white, around the bulb, and so I will

01:51: go ahead and click and hold on the Quick Selection tool, 
and select the Magic Wand from the flyout menu.

01:56: This is a great use for the wand, by the way.

01:58: I will press the Enter key in order to 
highlight the Tolerance value, and then I will change

02:02: it to 0, and I will turn off the Anti-alias 
checkbox, and then I'll click somewhere in

02:07: that background, and I can see that I have got 
this big area of white surrounding the bulb.

02:12: That's great.

02:13: I want to get rid of the stuff that's not 
selected, so I will go up to the Select menu,

02:16: and choose the Inverse command, or press Control+Shift+
I, Command+Shift+I on the Mac. And then, of course,

02:22: I want to keep the bulb, so I will go ahead 
and switch to the standard Lasso tool, which

02:26: I can get by pressing the L key, and I will 
press the Alt key, or the Option key on the

02:30: Mac, which allows me to subtract from the 
selection, and I will just drag around the bulb, like

02:35: so, and then I will release.

02:38: Now everything that remains selected needs 
to be white, so I will press the D key to

02:42: ensure I have got my default colors, and I 
will press Control+Backspace, or Command+Delete

02:46: on the Mac, in order to get 
rid of all that garbage.

02:49: All right, now I will press Control+D, or Command+
D on the Mac, in order to deselect the image,

02:54: and I am going to go ahead and double-click 
on this background inside of the Layers panel,

02:58: and I'll rename this new layer lightbulb, 
and click OK, and now I will copy the image

03:02: to my composition by right-clicking anywhere 
inside the image window, and choosing Duplicate

03:06: Layer, and I will set the Document to Wrestlers 
simplified, which is the name of my image,

03:12: and I will click OK.

03:13: All right, now I will switch back to that 
image, and you can see that the light bulb is

03:17: doing a great job of 
covering up the composition,

03:20: but the composition is here.

03:21: I will turn the lightbulb 
layer off, so you can see.

03:24: Now I will turn it back on.

03:25: Now, you may think the thing to do, and 
frequently I will hear this from folks;

03:29: the thing to do to get rid of that white 
background is to reselect the Magic Wand tool, and then

03:34: click inside the image, and delete the white, 
and you will end up with a bunch ratty edges,

03:39: and it'll look terrible.

03:40: That's not what you want to do at all.

03:42: Instead, you want to just go ahead and select 
that when in doubt darken mode: Multiply.

03:48: And because I have the Selection tool active, I 
can just press Shift+Alt+M, or Shift+Option+M

03:53: on the Mac, and that automatically drops out the 
whites. And it does so temporarily, of course.

03:58: It is still there; you can see 
that in the layer thumbnail,

04:01: but we are able to exactly get rid of them, 
and seamlessly integrate the light bulb with

04:05: one blend mode, and nothing more.

04:07: All right, I am going to press the M key to 
switch back to the Rectangular Marquee tool,

04:10: and now we need to transform the light bulb; 
scale, and rotate it, and apply a little bit

04:15: of distortion as well,

04:16: so it properly matches the scene. And actually, I 
want to transform the light bulb nondestructively,

04:22: so I'll go ahead and convert 
the lightbulb to a Smart Object.

04:26: Now, generally speaking -- this 
is just by way of advice --

04:29: generally speaking your best off applying the 
blend mode after you create the Smart Object.

04:33: You don't have to work that way, but 
it gives you the most flexibility.

04:37: So I am going to reset this layer to Normal 
by pressing Shift+Alt+N, or Shift+Option+N

04:42: on the Mac, then I will go to the Layers panel 
flyout menu, and choose Covert to Smart Object,

04:47: or if you loaded dekeKeys, you can press Control+Comma 
or Command+Comma, and now I will press Shift+Alt+M,

04:52: or Shift+Option+M, in order to apply 
Multiply to the overall Smart Object.

04:58: Now let's transform it, so I will go up to 
the Edit menu, and choose a Free Transform

05:02: command, or you can press Control+T, or Command+T 
on the Mac, and I want to start things off

05:06: by reducing the size of this bulb.

05:08: I happen to know that 
it wants to be about 55%.

05:11: So I will click on the chain icon up here in 
the options bar, click on W to select that

05:17: value, and change it to 55, and now I will 
go ahead and drag this guy up a little bit,

05:22: and rotate the bulb by dragging outside the 
bounding box, and I'm rotating it at this

05:27: one about 26.5 degrees, but you can go your 
own way. And now I'll move this guy up, and

05:32: he is a little slanted, as you can see here.

05:35: So I will Control+Drag or Command+Drag one of 
the side handles until the bottom of the bulb

05:40: looks pretty darn straight, and I think that's 
going to work, but I'd like the bulb to be

05:44: a little taller as well.

05:45: So I'll go ahead and drag on the bottom handle, 
and that ends up making the bulb look a little

05:51: crooked, I am thinking here.

05:52: So I am sort of going back and 
forth, just eyeballing things.

05:55: I will Control+Drag or Command+Drag the bottom 
handle, in order to slant the bottom of the

06:01: bulb to the right, and this ends 
up looking pretty good to me.

06:05: All right, now I will press the Enter key, or 
the Return key on the Mac, in order to apply

06:09: that transformation. Because we are working 
with a Smart Object, this is a nondestructive

06:13: modification, so obviously if you want to make 
further changes, all you have to do is press

06:18: Control+T, or Command+T on the Mac, to 
re-enter that Free Transform mode.

06:22: All right, so that gets us about half the 
way there, but you may recall that we are

06:26: actually interested in coloring the light bulb, 
as well as taking those black rays, and making

06:31: them bright, and I'll show you how to pull 
off those modifications, again with the help

06:35: of blending, in the next movie.


 ** Blending inside blend modes

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to pull 
off what I call blending inside blend modes.

00:05: So here is the idea.

00:06: You are looking at this composition, and you 
are thinking this black and white bulb really

00:10: doesn't match the natural warmth of the scene,
so you have got to do something about that.

00:14: And then the client comes to you and says, 
you know, it doesn't even make any sense that

00:17: these rays of light coming off the bulb are 
black. Even though that's the artwork I gave

00:22: you, I want you to change them to bright yellow, 
and while you're at it, make the bulb glow too.

00:28: Turns out, it's really easy to 
pull this off once you know how.

00:31: There's a little selecting and masking involved,
but it's mostly a matter of combining the

00:35: color overlay layer effect, 
along with some advanced blending.

00:39: So let's start by colorizing the bulb.

00:41: I will drop down to the fx icon at the 
bottom of the panel, and choose Color Overlay.

00:46: As usual, we don't want red, so I will click 
on the color swatch, and I came up with a Hue

00:50: value of 40, a Saturation of 100% is fine, 
and then a Brightness of 65%, then click OK.

00:58: Now, typically when you want to colorize a 
layer, you change the blend mode or the color

01:02: overlay effect from Normal to Color.

01:06: But that ends up giving us a pretty garish 
effect; not really what I'm looking for.

01:10: I want to match some of the 
natural browns inside the scene.

01:13: So I am going to apply the first of the contrast 
modes, which we will be discussing in the future

01:18: movie; specifically Overlay, 
and we end up with this effect.

01:22: Now, you can see the bulb is nice and 
brown, but we do have a few problems here.

01:28: This color overlay set to the Overlay mode 
is affecting the background art as well, so

01:32: the model's faces are turning orange.

01:35: That's a problem.

01:36: Well, here is how you solve it.

01:38: You go back to Blending Options here in the 
left-hand list, and you will see mid way down

01:42: a series of checkboxes, and while these 
checkboxes have some pretty cryptic names, just bear

01:47: in mind that they're all 
designed to solve problems.

01:50: In our case, we are applying the color overlay 
effect after we are multiplying the

01:55: light bulb into the composition.

01:56: What we want to do is reverse that order, and if 
you turn on Blend Interior Effects as Group,

02:02: then you first apply color overlay with the 
Overlay mode to the lightbulb layer, and then

02:07: you multiply that effect into the artwork, and 
we end up getting this seamless transition.

02:12: All right, now I will click OK 
in order to accept that affect.

02:16: Now we need to make those black rays bright.

02:19: So I will start things off by switching to 
the Elliptical Marquee tool, and then I will

02:23: drag around the light bulb, and I have got 
the Shift key down, so I am tracing a perfect

02:27: circle, and I am using the spacebar in order 
to align that circle around the main portion

02:32: of the bulb there at the top, and then I will 
press Shift+M to switch back to the Rectangular

02:37: Marquee tool, and I will Shift+Drag like that
in order to enclose the bottom portion of

02:43: the light bulb. And this is 
not a very accurate selection;

02:46: it looks like a key hole, but it does a great job of 
separating the rays of light from the bulb itself.

02:52: Now drop down to the bottom of Layers panel, 
and click on the Add Layer Mask icon in order

02:57: to mask away those rays.

02:59: Now we need to separate the rays on an independent 
layer, so we need to regain access to our last

03:04: selection outline, which you can do by going 
up to the Select menu, and choosing Reselect,

03:08: or pressing Control+Shift+D, or 
Command+Shift+D on the Mac.

03:12: We need to select the rays, not the blubs, so 
revisit the Select menu, and choose Inverse,

03:17: or press Control+Shift+I, Command+Shift+I on 
the Mac, then click on the thumbnail for the

03:21: layer itself here inside the Layers panel, 
and press Control+Alt+J, or Command+Option+J on

03:27: the Mac, and we will go ahead and call this 
new layer rays, and then click OK, and you now

03:32: have the rays separated 
to an independent layer.

03:35: Now, for what it's worth, the rays are a pixel-based 
layer; they're not a Smart Object, but that's okay.

03:40: We don't need them to be.

03:41: All right, we want to make them bright, so 
press Control+I, or Command+I on the Mac, in order

03:46: to invert that layer, and then switch from 
Multiply to Multiply's opposite, which is Screen,

03:53: and you will end up 
screening those rays of light.

03:56: Problem is, they're white; we 
want them to be bright yellow.

04:00: So notice that we still have 
the color overlay effect.

04:03: We also have this little double box item here, 
which is telling us that there are some advanced

04:08: blending options at work.

04:09: Go ahead and double-click on it, and that'll 
bring up the Blending Options panel inside

04:13: the Layer Style dialog box, and what it 
means is this checkbox has been turned on.

04:18: So Blend Interior Effects as 
Group is still turned on.

04:21: That's what we want,

04:21: so it's excellent news.

04:22: I will go ahead and switch to Color Overlay, 
and we want to burn this color into the white,

04:28: which means the blend mode we want, and this 
may seem strange, but it's Multiply, because

04:33: that way we will colorize those white 
lines with whatever color we select.

04:38: Now, I want this color to be a little 
brighter, so I will click on the color swatch, and I

04:42: found that I just needed to switch out the 
Saturation and Brightness values, so I will

04:46: change Saturation to 65%, and Brightness to 100%, and 
then click OK, and we get these bright rays of light.

04:53: Now, you need to remember those values, by the 
way. I will click on the swatch again; 40,

04:58: 65, 100, because we are going to use 
them to create the glow as well.

05:02: All right, now go ahead and click the OK button 
in order to apply that change, and now let's

05:07: create a new layer below the light bulb. So 
I will click on the wrestlers layer, press

05:11: Control+Shift+N, or Command+Shift+N on Mac, in 
order to create a new layer. I will name it

05:15: glow, and click OK.

05:16: And now I will switch to the Gradient tool 
by clicking on it, or you can press the G key,

05:22: and I want a radial gradient, so I will go 
ahead and click on the second item in, and

05:26: I also want to switch to 
Foreground to Transparent.

05:30: Now my foreground color is wrong.

05:31: I don't want black,

05:33: so I will go ahead and dial in that same color 
that we applied for the last color overlay.

05:38: So the Hue value should be 40 degrees, we 
want a Saturation value of 65%, and a Brightness

05:43: of 100%, and then I will drag from the center 
here outward to about this location in order

05:50: to create a bright glow.

05:52: Now, currently the glow is opaque, so you have to 
press the M key to switch back to the Rectangular

05:57: Marquee tool, so you have a Selection tool 
active, and then you can press Shift+Alt+S,

06:02: or Shift+Option+S on the Mac, to switch to 
the screen mode. And I want to make just one

06:07: more modification.

06:08: I am going to click on the lightbulb layer, 
which is the next layer up, to make it active,

06:12: and I want to increase the intensity of that 
light bulb effect, so I get a little more

06:17: saturation out of it.

06:18: I will press Shift+Plus in order to advance 
to the Color Burn mode. Obviously that's not

06:23: what I want, so I will press Shift+Plus again 
in order to advance to the Linear Burn mode,

06:28: and that looks much better.

06:30: So just for the sake of comparison, I 
will press Shift+Alt+M, or Shift+Option+M.

06:34: That's the Multiply version of the light bulb,
and if I press Control+Z, or Command+Z on the

06:39: Mac, this is the more 
intense Linear Burn version.

06:42: And that folks, strange as it may seem, is how 
you combine a layer effect with some advanced

06:48: blending in order to effectively blend 
inside blend modes here inside Photoshop.


 ** Overlay and the contrast modes

00:00: In this movie, I will demonstrate the next 
group of blend modes, which are the so-called

00:04: contrast modes, that I've color-coded in green 
inside of this diagram, beginning with Overlay,

00:09: and ending with Hard Mix.

00:11: Each one of them brightens the highlights, 
and darkens the shadows, meaning that they

00:15: all increase the contrast of the image, and 
in each case, gray is treated as a neutral

00:20: color, meaning that 50% gray turns invisible.

00:24: Now, the good news is they are all 
based on modes we've seen so far.

00:28: Overlay, Soft Light, and Hard Light are 
combinations of Screen and Multiply.

00:32: So Photoshop screens the brightest 
stuff, and multiplies the darkest stuff.

00:36: Vivid Light is a combination of Color Dodge 
and Color Burn working together. Linear Light

00:41: is a combination of the two linear modes, and then 
Pin Light is a combination of Lighten and Darken.

00:47: Hard Mix, as we'll see, is its own thing.

00:50: All right, so let's switch to this composition 
featuring this model masked against a blue sky background.

00:55: I also have this layer called sunlight.

00:57: I will go ahead and turn it on, and select it, and 
notice that it contains a few clouds as well.

01:02: Now, I want to clip it inside of the model 
layer, so I will press the Alt key, or the

01:05: Option key on the Mac, and click the horizontal line 
below sunlight, and we end up with this effect here.

01:11: Now, the idea behind the contrast modes, generally 
speaking, is that you want to wrap the luminance

01:15: levels of the active layer around 
the contours of the layers below.

01:20: So in other words, we are going to paint the 
model with the colors inside the sunlight layer.

01:24: So I will start things off by clicking on 
Normal in order to bring up the blend mode

01:27: pop-up menu, and I will select the when in 
doubt blend mode; so just as Screen is the

01:32: most practical lighten mode, and Multiply is 
the most practical darken mode, Overlay is

01:36: your most practical contrast mode. And you 
can see that we are wrapping the clouds from

01:41: the sunlight layer onto the model's 
skin over here on the left arm.

01:45: Now, what's interesting about this mode -- where 
Overlay is unique is that it makes its decisions

01:51: based on the contents of the underlying layers. So 
wherever we have bright colors in the underlying

01:56: layers, Overlay uses the active layer to 
further brighten the composition. Wherever we have

02:02: dark colors, 50% gray or darker, in the 
underlying layers, then Photoshop goes ahead and uses

02:08: the active layer in order 
to darken the composition.

02:11: And we will see why that makes 
a difference in just a moment.

02:14: If Overlay is too over the top for you, then I 
will press the Escape key, so that the blend

02:18: mode option is no longer active here on the 
PC, then you can reduce the Opacity of the

02:23: layer obviously, but if you want to soften 
the effect, go for something more organic,

02:28: then press Shift+Plus in order to advance 
to the Soft Light mode, and you can see that

02:32: the details from the active 
layer are much less obvious.

02:36: However, Soft Light and the others are making 
their decisions based on the active layer.

02:40: So where the active layer is 50% gray or lighter, 
then Photoshop is brightening the composition.

02:46: Where the active layer is 50% gray or darker,
Photoshop is darkening the composition.

02:51: Now, if you want something stronger than Overlay,
then you press Shift+Plus to advance to Hard

02:56: Light, and we get this 
absolutely stunning effect here.

03:00: So it may come as a surprise that Hard Light 
and Overlay are actually the same blend mode;

03:05: however, they examine the image differently.

03:08: Hard Light applies the same equations in the 
background, but it does so based on the luminance

03:12: levels of the active layer. So 
let me show you what I mean.

03:15: I will go up to the Image menu, and choose 
the Duplicate command, and I will call it Mode

03:20: comparison, and then click OK. And I am going 
to swap the sunlight and model layers for each

03:25: other. So I will grab that model layer there; 
the top one. Drag it on top, grab the layer

03:29: mask; drag it and drop it on the sunlight 
layer. Go ahead and clip the model inside

03:34: the sunlight layer, click in the sunlight 
layer, and press Shift+Alt+N, or Shift+Option+N

03:39: on the Mac, in order to restore it to the 
Normal mode. Then I will click on this model layer,

03:43: which is called Normal, because that's the mode 
she's set to, and I will change her to Overlay

03:49: by selecting Overlay from the blend mode pop-up 
menu. And you can see, now, this is how that

03:54: composition looks when the sunlight layer is 
on top set to Hard Light, and this is how

03:58: things look when the model 
layer is on top set to overlay.

04:01: That is to say, we get an identical effect.

04:04: Now, this may seem a little bit academic, but 
it can make a big difference when it comes

04:08: to deciding the order and blending 
options that you assign to your layers.

04:13: All right, I will switch back to my image in 
progress here, and I will go ahead and advance

04:17: to the next mode, which is Vivid Light.

04:19: It's that combination of Color Dodge and Color 
Burn working together, and we get this over

04:23: the top, fantastically saturated effect.

04:27: If you want something with even more contrast, 
without necessarily the garish saturation, then press

04:32: Shift+Plus in order to advance to Linear Light.
Now, what I am going to tell you is the best

04:38: contrast modes for working 
inside Photoshop on a regular basis

04:42: are Shift+Alt+O, or Shift+Option+O on the 
Mac, for Overlay; Shift+Alt+H, or Shift+Option+H

04:48: on the Mac, for hard light; and then Shift+Alt+J, 
or Shift+Option+J on the Mac, for Linear Light.

04:55: Think of the Ls in Linear 
Lights being backwards.

04:58: Next I will press Shift+Plus 
to advance the Pin Light.

05:00: As I say, that is the same as Lighten and 
Darken working together, and so what Photoshop

05:05: is doing is looking at the channels independently, 
and evaluating whether the bright pixels of

05:11: the active layer are the brightest, or the 
bright pixels on the underlying layer are

05:16: brightest, and doing the same thing with the 
darker pixels as well. And so we end up creating

05:21: these pretty high contrast effects 
on a channel by channel basis here.

05:25: Notice, in the case of green channel, we are 
keeping these bright rays of light up in the

05:28: model's hair, but we are losing 
the clouds down on her blouse,

05:33: whereas if I switch to the blue channel, we 
are getting the clouds back in the blouse,

05:36: but we are losing a lot of the highlights in 
the hair. And then Photoshop just goes ahead

05:40: and throws all the channels 
together to create the composite effect.

05:44: The last of the Contrast 
modes is the least impressive.

05:47: This is Hard Mix, by the way, and what it's 
doing is finding the brightest or darkest

05:52: pixels on a channel by channel basis, but it's 
calculating a threshold as well, meaning that

05:57: it's just keeping black or white in the red channel, 
the green channel, and finally, in the blue channel.

06:04: The reason we are keeping all these grays 
in the background is because that sunlight

06:08: layer is clipped inside the model.

06:10: As a result, you end up with just a handful 
of colors, in this case, black, white, yellow,

06:14: and red, but you might also end up seeing 
green, cyan, blue, and magenta as well.

06:19: Now, in case you are thinking there is never 
a time in a million years where I'm going

06:23: to use that mode, I'll show you how to 
mitigate Hard Mix in order to achieve pretty great

06:29: effects in a future movie.

06:31: For now, though, I'll go ahead and press Shift+Alt+H, 
or Shift+Option+H on the Mac, in order to restore

06:36: the Hard Light mode, which for this image 
provides me with my favorite effect, and that's how

06:41: you go about applying the contrast modes. 
Remember, start with Overlay. If that's too

06:45: much, try out Soft Light.

06:47: If Overlay is not enough, skip ahead to Hard 
Light, and if that's still not enough, give

06:50: Linear Light a try.


 ** A few great uses for the contrast modes

00:00: In this movie, I'm going to share a few really 
great tips and tricks for using the contrast

00:04: modes, both to increase the contrast of an 
image, and to reduce the contrast of an image.

00:11: Let's say you want to increase the contrast 
for effect, as in the case of this image here.

00:15: I'll go ahead and merge the contents of all 
the visible layers onto a new layer by pressing

00:20: Control+Shift+Alt+E, or Command+
Shift+Option+E on the Mac.

00:23: And then I'll go ahead and rename this layer 
grayness, because I'm going to turn it into

00:27: a grayscale version of itself by going up to 
the Image menu, choosing Adjustments, and

00:32: then choosing Desaturate, or if you loaded 
dekeKeys, you can press Control+Shift+Alt+U, or

00:37: Command+Shift+Option+U on the Mac.

00:39: Then you want to go ahead and try out 
the Overlay and Hard Light blend modes.

00:43: So assuming one of my Selection tools is active,
I'll press Shift+Alt+O, or Shift+Option+O on

00:48: the Mac, in order to apply the Overlay mode, and 
then I'll press Shift+Alt+H, or Shift+Option+H

00:53: on the Mac, in order to 
apply the Hard Light mode.

00:57: And so, just to give you a sense of the 
difference here, this is the image without that grayness

01:02: layer; this is the image with that grayness layer, adding 
contrast, without heightening the saturation of the colors.

01:09: Now, it may look as if we're blowing highlights inside 
the model's hair, but this actually isn't the case.

01:15: And you can test it for yourself by dropping 
down to the black/white icon, and choosing

01:19: the Levels command.

01:21: And then if I press the Alt key, or the Option key 
on the Mac, and drag the black slider triangle,

01:26: you can see that nothing is 
clipped inside the image right now.

01:29: And then if I press the Alt or Option key, and 
click and hold on the white slider triangle,

01:33: I can see that there is a little clipping in 
the Red channel, in the model's hair right

01:38: there at that white spot, but not very much 
actually, and we have to drag this White point

01:43: down to a value of about 250 before I see anything 
in the way of clipping that would concern me.

01:49: So I'll go ahead and press the Backspace key, 
or the Delete key on the Mac, in order to get

01:52: rid of that Levels layer.

01:54: So the idea is this: because Overlay, Soft 
Light, and Hard Light are based on Multiply,

01:59: and Screen, then you're not going to add any 
clipping to the image that you didn't already

02:03: have in the first place. All right.

02:05: Now I'll switch over to this image here.

02:07: Let's say you want to increase the contrast of an 
image for the sake of correcting that image.

02:12: Well, you can go with the technique I just 
showed you; that is, creating a grayscale version

02:16: of the image, or you can work with an adjustment 
layer, which is going to give you more control.

02:21: So press and hold the Alt key, or the Option 
key on the Mac, click the black/white icon

02:24: at the bottom of the Layers panel, and choose 
Vibrance, or if you loaded dekeKeys, you can

02:28: press Control+Shift+V, or Command+Shift+V on the 
Mac, and I'll go ahead and call this layer

02:33: grayness as well.

02:34: And then I'll crank the Saturation value down 
to -100. And again, you could experiment with

02:40: the Overlay mode if you want to. I'm going 
to go direct for Hard Light here in order

02:44: to achieve this effect.

02:45: Now, we've got some great contrast; however, 
we don't have all the saturation we need.

02:51: So I'll once again click inside the Saturation 
value here in the Properties panel, and then

02:55: I'll incrementally raise it by pressing Shift+up 
arrow until I get a level of saturation that I like.

03:01: And for me that happens at a 
Saturation value of -20%.

03:05: So despite the fact that we're actually leaching 
saturation from the image using this Vibrance

03:10: adjustment layer, the Hard Light mode is increasing 
the contrast to the extent that we get more

03:16: saturation, not less.

03:17: And once again, just to give you a sense of 
what we've accomplished here, this is the

03:20: before version of the image; not only very 
washed out, but some weird wandering colors

03:25: in the midtones there; and this is the after version,
with much better color throughout. All right.

03:32: Now let's say you want to take 
the contrast out of an image.

03:35: So here is this high contrast barn that 
we took a look at back in Chapter 26.

03:39: Now, the Curves adjustment layer is still 
your best bet for correcting the contrast

03:44: of your image, but let's say 
you just don't have the time.

03:46: You want to get, say, half the work 
done in about a tenth of the time.

03:50: Well, then you drop down to the black/white 
icon, and choose Invert in order to add an

03:55: Invert adjustment layer.

03:56: Now, there are no options for this layer. so I'll 
just go ahead and close the Properties panel.

04:01: And then the next step is to press Shift+Alt+O, 
or Shift+Option+O on the Mac, in order to apply

04:06: the Overlay mode.

04:08: So it's just a two step operation; create an 
Invert adjustment layer, apply the Overlay

04:12: adjustment mode, and you're done.

04:14: Now, again, this effect doesn't measure up to 
what we did back in Chapter 26, but I also

04:19: spent less than a minute just now 
showing you how to do it. All right!

04:22: I'm going to switch to my final image here.

04:24: Now, by now you know that you can use a High 
Pass adjustment layer to add sharpness to

04:28: an image. What if you want to add smoothness?

04:31: Well, here is a technique 
you might want to try out.

04:33: I'll go ahead and create a copy of this layer 
by pressing Control+Alt+J, or Command+Option+J

04:38: on the Mac, and I'll 
call this layer high pass.

04:41: And then I'll go up to the Filter menu, and 
I'll choose Other, and then I'll choose High

04:45: Pass, or if you loaded 
dekeKeys, you can press Shift+F10.

04:49: And I'm going to set the Radius 
of this image to about 10 pixels.

04:52: And the idea is, I want of fill in the creases 
on this gentleman's face, and I estimate that

04:58: they're about 10-20 pixels thick,
so this should fill it in.

05:02: And then click OK in 
order to accept that effect.

05:05: Now I want to convert this layer to grayscale, so 
I'll go up to the Image menu, choose Adjustments,

05:10: and choose Desaturate.

05:12: And then finally, I'll press Shift+Alt+O, or 
Shift+Option+O on the Mac, in order to apply

05:17: the Overlay mode.

05:18: Now if I turn the layer off, and then back on,
you can see that we're adding sharpness,

05:23: so we're actually 
emphasizing the details in his face.

05:27: If you want to do the opposite, then with that 
high pass layer selected, just press Control+I,

05:32: or Command+I on the Mac, 
in order to invert it,

05:35: and you can see that those 
details pretty near disappear.

05:38: Now, we don't want to go that far with the 
effect, so I'll press the 5 key in order to

05:42: back it off, so that we get this effect here.

05:45: And then, so we don't have these 
sort of unnatural transitions here,

05:49: I'm going to apply a little bit of Gaussian 
Blur by going up to the Filter menu, choosing

05:53: Blur, and then choosing Gaussian Blur.

05:56: And I decided to go with a Radius value of 2.

06:00: And it's not a big difference, by the way. If 
you turn off the Preview checkbox, and then

06:04: turn it back on; I'll go ahead and zoom in 
actually another click, so we can hopefully

06:08: see some kind of difference here.

06:10: So this is before the Gaussian Blur.

06:12: You can see that we don't 
have much detail at all.

06:14: We just have a bunch of color transitions.

06:17: And then if I turn Preview back on, we restore 
some of that detail, which is ironic, because

06:22: we're blurring the layer.

06:23: Anyway, I'll go ahead and click OK in order 
to accept that change, and then I'll go ahead

06:28: and zoom back out here.

06:30: Now then, let's say I want to lighten up 
the side of his face just a little bit.

06:33: Well, you can create a kind of 
dodge effect using the Overlay mode.

06:37: I'll press Control+Shift+N, or Command+Shift+N on 
the Mac, and call this layer dodge; click OK.

06:42: Go ahead and grab the Brush tool.

06:44: I'll right-click inside the image window to 
show you that my Hardness value is set to

06:47: 0%, so we've got a soft brush, and I'm going 
to reduce the size of my brush a little bit.

06:52: Then I'm going to press the X key, so that 
White is my foreground color, and I'll just

06:56: paint inside these areas a little bit, 
just to give you a sense of how this works.

07:01: Then I'll press the M key to switch back to 
the Rectangular Marquee tool, and I'll switch

07:05: the mode from Normal to Soft Light. That ends 
up blending that lightness into the image.

07:10: Of course, we've gone too far, so I'll press 
the Escape key, so that the blend mode pop-up

07:14: menu is no longer active, and I'll press the 
2 key to reduce the Opacity value to 20%.

07:20: So this is the appearance of the image 
without that layer, and this is the appearance of

07:24: the image with that layer.

07:26: So it's just a quick and dirty dodge effect.

07:28: If you wanted to burn instead, 
you would paint with black.

07:30: Okay, finally a couple more corrections.

07:32: I'll press the Alt key, or the Option key on 
the Mac, click the black/white icon at the

07:35: bottom of the panel, choose Vibrance, and I'll 
go ahead and call this grayness once again.

07:41: And the idea is I want to add some more 
contrast back to this image, because we got rid of

07:45: some of the contrast 
with that high pass layer.

07:47: So I'll take the 
Saturation value down to -100%.

07:50: I'll set the blend mode this time to Soft 
Light, and then I'll crank the Saturation

07:55: value back up to -70%, and then 
I'll hide the Properties panel.

08:00: So this is what the image 
looked like without that layer;

08:02: this is how it looks now.

08:04: And finally, I think he's looking a little 
bit too reddish at this point, so I'm going

08:08: to click on the background 
in order to make it active.

08:11: And then I'll press the Alt key, or the Option 
key on the Mac, click the black/white icon

08:14: and choose Hue/Saturation, or if you loaded dekeKeys, 
you can press Control+Shift+U, or Command+Shift+U

08:19: on the Mac, and I'll call 
this orangeness, and click OK.

08:24: And then I'll go ahead and select the Target 
Adjustment tool, and I'll press the Control key,

08:28: or the Command key on the Mac, and click and 
drag to the right a little bit. And I actually

08:33: want to take that Hue value up to +5, 
just for the Reds, as you can see.

08:40: And so now I'll go ahead and 
hide the Properties panel.

08:42: And just to give you a sense of what we were 
able to accomplish where this image is concerned,

08:47: I'll press the Alt key, or the Option key on the Mac, 
and click on the eye in front of the Background.

08:51: This is the original version of the image, and 
this is the enhanced version of the image,

08:56: thanks to a combination of both contrast 
reductions, and enhancements, applied with the help of

09:02: the Overlay, Soft Light, 
and Hard Light blend modes.


 ** Difference, Exclusion, Subtract, and Divide

00:00: In this movie, I'll demonstrate the fifth group 
of blend modes, which are color-coded in purple

00:04: inside of this diagram.

00:06: The first two -- Difference, and Exclusion -- are 
inversion modes that have been included in

00:10: the software for a long time now.

00:13: The other two were added recently, and 
they're known as the cancelation modes.

00:17: And the thinking was, according 
to some programmers at Adobe,

00:20: they wanted to round out the 
basic arithmetic.

00:23: So where the Layers panel is concerned, we already 
had Linear Dodge, which adds luminance levels,

00:28: so we might as well get Subtract as well, 
and then we've got Multiply, which actually

00:33: does multiply luminance levels, so they 
figured they might as well add Divide.

00:38: Neither of them is terribly useful for layering, 
and in truth, they're duplicates of blend modes

00:43: that already exist.

00:45: So let me show you what's up here.

00:46: I'm going to switch over to this version of 
the image with light bulb, and I'm going to

00:50: scroll down to the wrestlers layer.

00:52: I'll go ahead and select it, and I'm going 
to change the blend mode from Linear Burn

00:55: to Difference, which incidentally is far and a 
way the most useful of this group of modes.

01:01: Now, what we're seeing here is Photoshop is 
subtracting the luminance level on the active

01:05: layer from the luminance level 
on the composite layers below.

01:09: So, for example, when you subtract black, as 
in the jackets, you don't do anything, so

01:14: black is a neutral color, which is 
why we can see through the jackets.

01:18: On the other hand, when you subtract white, 
as in the case of this background, you do

01:21: serious damage to an image, because 
white is such a big thing to subtract.

01:26: So the question is, why don't we 
just see blackness in the background?

01:30: And the answer is because 
Photoshop is taking in absolute value.

01:33: In other words, if the results of the formula is 
a negative number, Photoshop makes it positive.

01:39: And as a result, white ends up inverting.

01:42: So black does nothing, white inverts, and 
everything else does something in between,

01:48: which means that if you want to get a more 
normal effect, you need to invert the layer.

01:52: So I'm going to press the Alt key, or the 
Option key on the Mac, click the black/white icon

01:55: and choose the Invert Command.

01:57: I'm going to call this layer reverse, and turn 
on Use Previous Layer to Create Clipping Mask,

02:02: so we're inverting the active layer only,

02:04: and I'll click OK. And now, by virtue of the 
fact that we're turning the background black,

02:08: it has no effect, so we're seeing through to 
the parchment, and because we're inverting

02:12: the jackets to make them white, 
they are inverting the background.

02:17: Another thing to note about Difference is, 
when two like colors encounter each other,

02:21: in other words, the pixel on the active layer 
matches the pixel behind it, then the result

02:26: of the Difference mode is black.

02:28: Compare that, if I go ahead and click on the 
wrestler's layer, to the next blend mode in

02:32: the list; I'll press Shift+Plus 
in order to advance to Exclusion.

02:37: Exclusion does much of the same thing.

02:39: Black is the neutral color;
it doesn't do anything.

02:41: White inverts absolutely.

02:43: However, the colors in between don't go nearly 
as far, so when the luminance level of a pixel

02:48: matches that of the pixel 
behind it, you don't get black;

02:51: you get gray instead.

02:53: So exclusion produces a more tepid effect.

02:56: If I press Shift+Plus again, we advance to the 
Subtract mode, which goes ahead and subtracts

03:02: out the luminance levels without finding the 
absolute value the way that Difference mode does.

03:06: So it's very similar to Difference, with the 
big exception that white, which is the color

03:12: of the jackets now, because they've been inverted,
goes ahead and gets subtracted out to beyond

03:18: black, so you can end up getting 
some very, very dark effects indeed.

03:22: Now, you may look at this 
composition and think, gosh!

03:25: This looks pretty familiar,
and sure enough, it is.

03:28: If I go up to the File menu, and I choose 
Revert command, or I press F12, you're going to see

03:34: the exact same effect.

03:36: The big difference is that the wrestlers 
layer here is set to the Linear Burn mode,

03:40: whereas, if I press Control+Z, or Command+Z on 
the Mac, to reinstate the Subtract mode, again,

03:46: it looks exactly the same.

03:47: And that's because applying Linear Burn to a 
layer is the same as inverting that layer,

03:52: and then applying Subtract, which is why I 
say subtract isn't really a new mode, and it

03:58: also existed elsewhere inside the software.

04:00: All right, now let's switch over to this image, 
which is a variation on the composition with

04:06: a low contrast version of the 
wrestlers layer set to Color Dodge.

04:10: And the reason I'm setting it to Color Dodge 
is because Divide and Color Dodge are very

04:15: similar to each other.

04:16: So what I'm going to do is turn off this Reverse 
layer here, which is an Invert adjustment layer.

04:21: And you can see that Color Dodge now blows the 
heck out of the composition, and I'll switch

04:25: the mode from Color Dodge to Divide, and 
we end up getting the exact same effect.

04:31: And to prove that, I'll go back up to the 
File menu, and choose the Revert command, or press

04:36: F12, and we're seeing exactly the same thing.

04:39: So applying the Divide mode to a layer is 
exactly the same thing as inverting the layer,

04:44: and applying Color Dodge.

04:45: All right, so that gives you a sense of how 
the Inversion and Cancelation modes work.

04:51: If you want to find out some uses for them, you 
can check out my Photoshop Masking & Compositing:

04:56: Advanced Blending course, 
included along with lynda.com.

05:00: To learn a really great use for the 
Difference mode, stay tuned for the very next movie.


 ** Capturing the differences between images

00:00: In this movie, I am going to show you a 
terrific use for the Difference blend mode.

00:03: Basically, it is the go to mode any time you 
are trying to find the differences between

00:07: a couple of images, and that's because if a 
pixel on the active layer is the same color

00:13: as the pixel behind it, then the composite 
pixel turns black, which means that anything

00:18: that's not black is at difference.

00:20: So let's say I am trying to create a 
screenshot of the Gradient Mesh feature inside Adobe

00:25: Illustrator, and I went ahead and drew these 
two peppers, and now we're seeing the mesh

00:29: points throughout.

00:30: And in my case, they are showing up as orange 
against a red background, which isn't a terrific

00:35: amount of contrast.

00:36: Now, I could have changed the color of those 
points in Illustrator, but I wanted still

00:40: more control than that.

00:42: What I wanted to be able to do was dim the 
peppers back, like you see them here, and

00:46: then turn the points black, so that there 
is no ambiguity whatsoever, whether I show

00:52: this image on screen, at my Web site, or whether I put 
it in one of my books, you can see those mesh points.

00:58: So I'll go ahead and switch 
back to the image at hand.

01:00: Here's what we've got.

01:02: I took one screenshot of the peppers with 
the mesh point selected, and I took another

01:06: screenshot of the peppers deselected, and 
then I went ahead and set one on top of the

01:11: other, and with the gradient mesh layer 
selected here, I'll go ahead and switch the

01:15: blend mode from Normal to Difference, 
and we end up getting this effect here.

01:20: So you can see everything that's not part of the mesh 
becomes black, and only the mesh lines remain.

01:25: Now we need to turn all the differences white,

01:27: so press Control+Shift+Alt+E, or Command+Shift+Option+E 
on the Mac, in order to merge the composite

01:33: layers onto a new layer, and I'll call this new layer 
merged, and then you need to apply two adjustments.

01:39: You go up to the Image menu, choose Adjustments, 
and choose Desaturate, or if you loaded dekeKeys,

01:44: you can press Control+Shift+Alt+U, or Command+Shift+
Option+U on the Mac, and that goes ahead and gets rid

01:49: of all the color.

01:50: And then you go up to the Image menu, choose 
Adjustments, and choose a command we haven't

01:54: seen so far, Threshold, which allows you to turn all 
pixels on the active layer either black or white.

02:01: And the reason this feature is called 
Threshold is because this slider triangle right there

02:06: represents the threshold.

02:08: If I take it down to, say, 110, then anything 
with a Luminance level of 110 or brighter

02:13: becomes white; anything with a Luminance 
level of 110 or darker becomes black.

02:18: You can see we have got this 
tiny little histogram right there.

02:21: We need to move the slider 
triangle all the way to the left of it.

02:25: I ended up going with a Threshold level of 30,
but I could have selected 20, for example,

02:29: and gotten exactly the same results.

02:32: As long as I'm inside of this area,
it doesn't matter. All right.

02:35: So I'll click OK.

02:36: I've now got the white mesh point lines; 
everything that's not a mesh point is black. I want to

02:40: convert that mesh to a selection, so I'll 
switch to the Channels panel, and press the

02:46: Control key, or the Command key on the Mac, and 
click on RGB, and that goes ahead and selects

02:50: anything that's white, and 
deselects anything that's black.

02:53: Now I'll switch to the Layers panel, turn 
off both merged, and grad mesh, so we are just

02:59: seeing the no mesh versions of the peppers.

03:01: I'll press Control+Shift+N, or Command+Shift+N 
on the Mac, to create a new layer.

03:05: I'll call the layer mesh lines, and then I'll 
press the Enter key, or the Return key on the

03:09: Mac, and I will press Alt+Backspace, or Option+
Delete on the Mac, to fill the selection with black.

03:15: So we now have the black mesh lines.

03:17: Go ahead and click outside the selection in 
order to deselect it, and now let's go ahead

03:22: and give this no mesh layer a special treatment,
so that it fades back, and I am going to do

03:27: that using a layer effect.

03:29: So click on the fx icon, choose Color Overlay, 
and then click on the color swatch, and I recommend

03:35: you change the Saturation to 0, 
and then change Brightness to 90.

03:40: We need it to be bright, but 
something less than white.

03:43: So 90% will work.

03:45: Go ahead and click OK, and then switch the 
blend mode to Luminosity, so that we take

03:50: out the luminance, but we leave the color 
behind, and then to bring back some of that

03:55: luminance, I reduced the Opacity 
value to 70%, and then click OK.

04:00: And we end up achieving that effect that we 
saw at the outset of the movie in which the

04:04: mesh lines are clearly distinguished 
from the artwork in the background.

04:08: And that's one of the many ways to use the 
Difference blend mode in order to find the

04:13: difference between two 
mostly identical images.


 ** Hue, Saturation, Color, and Luminosity

00:00: In this movie, I'll demonstrate how to work 
with the final group of blend modes, which

00:04: are Hue, Saturation, Color, and Luminosity.

00:07: Together they make up the component modes, 
so called because these blend modes divide

00:11: an image into its color components.

00:14: Now, I'll be discussing these blend modes in 
opposite order, because that's the easiest

00:18: way to understand them.

00:20: I'll switch over to this image 
of the model against the sky.

00:23: You can see that she has a layer mask, 
which will become important in just a moment.

00:27: Now, let's say I want to keep all the detail 
information that's associated with the model,

00:31: but I want to let the blues 
from the background show through.

00:34: Any time you want to keep the Luminance 
levels for the active layer, then you change

00:38: the blend mode in the upper left corner of 
Layers panel from whatever it is -- Normal in

00:43: my case -- to Luminosity.

00:45: And notice now we can see all the detail of 
the model, but we're seeing the color of the

00:49: clouds show through in the background.

00:51: Now you may ask, well why are we seeing the 
luminance levels of the clouds outside of the model?

00:57: And that's because of the layer mask.

00:59: If I where to Shift+Click on this layer mask 
thumbnail to turn it off, then you can see now

01:03: we're overriding the background luminance, 
and we're just seeing the colors from the

01:08: clouds and the sky.

01:10: All right, I'll go a head and Shift+Click on 
the layer mask thumbnail to turn it back on.

01:14: The opposite of Luminosity is the next blend 
mode up, and that's Color, and let me show

01:19: you how that works.

01:20: I'll go ahead and click on the sunlight 
layer to make it active, and turn on as well.

01:24: Let's say we're not interested in any of 
the luminance information in this layer, but

01:28: we do want to colorize a 
composition using this layer.

01:31: Then with that layer active, you go to the 
blend mode pop-up menu once again, and this

01:35: time choose Color, and now we're seeing the 
color from the sunlight layer, and the luminance

01:40: information from the composite 
version of the two layers below.

01:45: All right, now we'll go and turn 
that sunlight layer off for a moment.

01:48: Here I am playing around in my image, and I 
decide to click on the model layer once again.

01:53: And in reviewing this composition, it bothers 
me that I can see the contours of the clouds,

01:58: because of the saturation 
levels that are showing through.

02:01: So sometimes we have these low saturation 
clouds coming into the model, and other times

02:05: we see this high saturation sky, and 
interferes with our view of the model, I think.

02:11: And so what I would like to do is 
retain the model's saturation levels.

02:14: In other words, I'd like to go ahead and 
apply not only the Luminosity blend mode, but the

02:18: Saturation blend mode as well.

02:20: Well that's not possible in Photoshop.

02:22: You can't apply a combination 
of two modes to the same layer.

02:25: So if that's the effect you're looking for, 
you will have to create a copy of layer.

02:30: And I'll do so by pressing the Escape key, so my 
blend mode option isn't active here in the PC.

02:34: And I'll press Control+Alt+J, or Command+Option+J 
in the Mac, in order to create a copy of this

02:40: model layer, and I'll call it 
saturation, and then I'll click OK.

02:45: And now I'll go a head and switch 
to the blend mode to Saturation.

02:48: And by the way, Color, and Luminosity, as I was 
telling you; they are commuted versions of each other.

02:54: So if you prefer, they 
are blend mode opposites.

02:58: Color is divided into these two ingredients; it's a 
combination of Hue and Saturation working together.

03:04: I'll go ahead and choose Saturation, and you 
can see now we've got more uniform saturation

03:09: levels that work inside the model, while 
still lifting those blues from the sky.

03:14: All right, now I'll go ahead and click on 
that sunlight layer, and turn it back on.

03:18: We've got all these garish oranges 
and yellows from the sunlight layer.

03:22: Let's imagine I really like that combination 
of saturation and luminance that's at work

03:27: in the layers below sunlight.

03:29: So if I want to keep all that luminance and 
saturation, I'll turn sunlight back on, and

03:34: instead of choosing Color, I'll apply Hue instead, 
and we end up getting this more organic effect.

03:41: All right, one more cool color 
trick I want to show you here.

03:44: I am going to go ahead and turn off the top two 
layers, and click on the model layer to make it active.

03:50: Press Shift+Alt+N, or Shift+Option+N on the 
Mac, in order to return it to the Normal mode.

03:55: So we're seeing that same view of the 
image we saw the outset of this movie.

03:58: Now let's say you want to invert 
just the colors inside the image.

04:02: You don't want to invert the Luminosity levels; 
just color. Then you'd drop down to the black/white

04:07: icon at the bottom of the panel, click on 
it, and choose Invert to create an Invert

04:12: adjustment layer.

04:13: There are no properties, so I'll hide the 
Properties panel, and then you'd switch to

04:17: the Color blend mode, which you can do from the 
keyboard, by the way, by pressing Shift+Alt+C,

04:22: or Shift+Option+C on a Mac, and that allows us 
to invert the colors inside the image, while

04:27: leaving the luminance 
information entirely unmodified.

04:31: And that's how you exploit the power of the 
component modes, which are, in opposite order,

04:36: Luminosity, Color, which is Luminosity's 
opposite, and then the two ingredients that make up

04:42: color: Saturation, and Hue.


 ** Blend mode shortcuts

00:00: In this movie, we'll review all of the 
shortcuts for the blend modes, and you can see that

00:04: it's Shift+Alt, or on the Mac, 
Shift+Option, along with a letter key.

00:10: And every single one of the 
letter keys is used, by the way; A through Z.

00:14: Now, if you're hoping to apply a blend mode 
to a layer, then these keyboard shortcuts

00:18: only work when one of the Selection tools 
is active, including the Eyedropper, or one

00:23: of these lower tools, from the Pen tool,
all the way down to the Zoom tool.

00:27: The reason that these keystrokes don't work 
when this middle group of tools is selected --

00:32: that is starting with the Healing Brush, and 
going down to the Dodge tool -- is because all

00:37: those tools have their own blend modes.

00:39: So for example, if I switch to the Brush tool, 
you can see this blend mode pop-up menu appear

00:44: in the Options bar.

00:45: I'll go ahead and Escape out there.

00:47: So if I press Shift+Alt+M, for example, or 
Shift+Option+M on the Mac, I don't change

00:52: the blend mode of the bars layer to Multiply; 
instead, I change the blend mode for the brush

00:57: to Multiply, which isn't what I want, so I'll 
press Shift+Alt+N, or Shift+Option+N on the

01:02: Mac, to restore the blend mode to Normal.

01:04: All right, now I'll press the M key to 
switch back to the Rectangular Marquee.

01:07: Now, there's an awful lot of shortcuts available 
to you; as I say, 26 in all, and some of them

01:13: make a lot of sense, like Shift+Alt+N or Shift+Option+N 
for Normal; lot of them don't make that much

01:18: sense, such as Shift+Alt+I or Shift+Option+I 
for Dissolve, which is why I try to include

01:23: reasoning behind the blend 
modes inside this chart.

01:26: And I've also gone ahead and drawn blue circles 
around those keyboard shortcuts that I think

01:31: are worth memorizing, because 
those are your key shortcuts.

01:35: So where the important ones are 
concerned here, we've got N for normal.

01:38: You drop down to Shift+Alt+M, or 
Shift+Option+M on the Mac, for Multiply.

01:43: Then we have a perfectly logical keyboard 
shortcut for Color Burn, which is B, but it's

01:47: not a mode that I use all that often; I doubt you 
will either, so probably not worth memorizing.

01:53: Linear Burn is a great mode; unfortunately, it 
doesn't have a very meaningful keyboard shortcut.

01:59: It's Shift+Alt+A, or Shift+Option+A on the Mac.

02:01: I suppose you could remember it because 
of the A in Linear, but I actually have a

02:06: better way of remembering that, at least one 
that's worked better for me, and I'll tell

02:10: you about it in just a moment.

02:12: We'll skip ahead to Shift+Alt+S or Shift+
Option+S for Screen, which makes perfect sense.

02:17: And now I'll go ahead and 
scroll down a little bit here.

02:20: Notice Color Dodge, great keyboard shortcut; 
Shift+Alt+D, or Shift+Option+D on the Mac,

02:24: but again, I don't use the mode very often, so I'm 
not sure it's worth memorizing the shortcut.

02:30: Linear Dodge (Add) is a fantastic mode 
that has a completely ridiculous shortcut.

02:36: It should have gotten A for Add, because that's the 
arithmetic that's at work behind Linear Dodge.

02:42: The way I remember how things work here is 
that Linear Burn, which is Linear Dodge's

02:46: nemesis of course, stole its shortcut, and left 
Linear Dodge with two upside down A's, which

02:53: if you remove the bar and 
squeeze them together make a W.

02:56: Anyway, I don't know if that's going to 
work for you or not. It works for me.

03:00: Overlay, Shift+Alt+O, or 
Shift+Option+O on the Mac.

03:04: Soft Light, of all the ones I didn't circle, 
that is the one that you might want to memorize.

03:08: It's Shift+Alt+F, or Shift+Option+F on the Mac; F 
being the second to last letter in Soft, of course.

03:14: Hard Light; completely reasonable 
shortcut of Shift+Alt+H or Shift+Option+H.

03:18: Vivid Light, great 
shortcut, not much of a mode.

03:21: Linear Light kind of got ripped off, and in 
fact, I'll go ahead and scroll down here.

03:25: It got ripped off by one of the least useful 
blend modes there is, which is Hard Mix, which

03:29: doesn't have an L in it at all.

03:32: Anyway, Linear Light instead 
gets a backward L, which is a J.

03:36: Then we drop down to Difference, another 
great mode; Shift+Alt+E or Shift+Option+E, which

03:42: is the last letter in Difference.

03:44: And then if we scroll down the list, you can 
see that we've got Shift+Alt+C or Shift+Option+C

03:48: for Color; makes perfect sense.

03:50: And then for Luminosity, we've got Shift+Alt+Y or Shift
+Option+Y, which is the last letter in the mode.

03:56: P, Q, and R, which are the only letters we 
haven't discussed so far, are assigned to blend

04:01: modes that are only available 
when the Brush tool is active.

04:05: So to demonstrate how these work, I'll go 
ahead and switch to the Brush tool, which

04:08: of course I can get by pressing the B key.

04:10: And notice this little airbrush 
icon up here in the options bar.

04:14: If I turn it on, and then I'll dial in a different color 
here in the color panel; a Hue value of 0 is fine.

04:19: I'll crank the Saturation value up to 100%, 
and crank Brightness up to 100% as well.

04:25: And let's make sure I've got a nice,
soft brush going. Indeed I do.

04:28: So the Hardness value is set to 0%, press 
the Enter key, or the Return key on the Mac,

04:32: in order to hide that panel.

04:34: And now notice, if I paint, whenever I keep 
my cursor still, I'm building up paint, much

04:40: as if I were working with 
a traditional airbrush.

04:44: So that's how that option works.

04:45: It's not really a blend mode at all, of course, but 
it has a keyboard shortcut, and it's Shift+Alt+P

04:51: or Shift+Option+P.

04:52: And so notice up here in the options bar, 
if I press Shift+Alt+P, or Shift+Option+P on

04:56: the Mac, that turns the airbrush icon off, and if I 
press that keystroke again, I turn the option on.

05:02: All right, I'm going to undo that brushstroke 
just by pressing Control+Z, or Command+Z on the Mac.

05:07: These next two -- Behind, and Clear -- are modes; at 
lease they're listed in the blend mode pop-up menu.

05:13: So if you press Shift+Alt+Q or Shift+Option+Q,
which is the next letter after P -- and I'll

05:17: go ahead and press that keyboard shortcut now --

05:20: you can see that I've switched to the 
Behind mode up here in the options bar.

05:23: And what that allows me to do; I'll paint on 
the bars layer, and notice that I'm painting

05:28: behind the bars, so I'm painting 
exclusively in a transparent portion of the layer.

05:34: Next we've got the Clear mode, and you get to 
it by pressing Shift+Alt+R, or Shift+Option+R

05:39: on the Mac, and notice I have switched to 
the Clear mode up here in the options bar.

05:43: And what that does is it allows me to paint 
away the contents of the layer, exactly as

05:49: if I were using the Eraser.

05:51: The idea is that the brush has more options 
than the Eraser tool does, and if you want

05:55: to take advantage of those options while 
still erasing, then you select the brush, and set

06:00: its mode to Clear.

06:01: Anyway, if you've been working along with me,
you probably want to press Shift+Alt+N,

06:04: or Shift+Option+N on the Mac, to go 
ahead and restore the Normal mode.

06:09: And those are the 26 blend modes, along with 
the ones circled in blue that I recommend

06:15: you assign to memory for the blend modes that 
are available to you here inside Photoshop.

06:20: 


 ** The Fill Opacity Eight

00:00: In this movie, I'll introduce you to what I 
call the Fill Opacity eight, which are eight blend

00:05: modes that respond better to an adjustment to 
the Fill value than they do to an adjustment

00:10: to the Opacity value.

00:12: And I'm here to tell you, I have 
no idea why things work this way;

00:16: I just know that they do work this way.

00:19: So just by way of a refresher, the main purpose 
of Fill Opacity is to reduce the Opacity

00:24: of a layer independently of its layer effects.

00:28: So here I'm looking at an example from Chapter 
16 of the Intermediate course, and notice that

00:33: I have some effects assigned to the shire layer.

00:35: I'll go ahead and turn them on; I've got an 
Inner Shadow and a Drop Shadow at work.

00:39: Now, if I decide I want to reduce the darkness 
inside the letters, then I could press, for

00:45: example, the 2 key in order to reduce the 
Opacity value, but that ends up reducing the Opacity

00:51: of the layer effects as well.

00:53: I don't want that, so I'll press the 
zero key to reinstate 100% Opacity.

00:58: Instead, what I want to do is press Shift+2 
in order to reduce the Fill Opacity value

01:03: to 20%, and that makes the letters themselves 
translucent, while leaving the layer effects intact.

01:08: All right.

01:09: So that's the primary purpose of Fill.

01:11: I'm going to switch over to my shortcuts file,
and if you got access to the file, you'll

01:16: see at the top of the Layers 
panel is a group called top secret.

01:19: Go ahead and twirl it open, and turn on the 
layer inside, and you'll see bars highlighting

01:24: each of the eight blend modes that 
respond differently to Fill Opacity.

01:29: And as you'll see, it's always better.

01:31: So we've got Color Burn, and Linear Burn, Color 
Dodge, and Linear Dodge, as well as Vivid Light,

01:37: Linear Light, Hard Mix --

01:38: you won't believe what a difference Fill makes 
with Hard Mix -- and then finally, Difference.

01:43: Now, I'm not going to show you examples of 
all of the modes, but I will show you how

01:46: things work with the Contrast 
modes, as well as Difference.

01:50: So I'll switch over to this file, in which 
I've set the sunlight layer to Hard Light.

01:55: And instead, I'm going to press Shift+Alt+V, or 
Shift+Option+V on a Mac, in order to advance

01:59: to Vivid Light, and then I'll press the 5 
key to reduce the Opacity value to 50%.

02:06: Now, we want to keep that effect, so what I'm 
going to do is create a layer comp, and you

02:10: do that by going up to the Window menu and 
choosing the Layer Comps command, which brings

02:14: up the Layer Comps panel. Go ahead and make 
it a little smaller here, so that takes up

02:18: less room onscreen, and I'll create a new 
comp by clicking on the little page icon.

02:23: I'll Name this comp Opacity blend.

02:26: And if you're working along with me, you 
want to make sure that Visibility is turned on,

02:30: and so is Appearance;

02:32: that's very important. Then click OK.

02:35: Now let's switch the Opacity value back to 
100% by pressing the 0 key, and I'll reduce

02:39: the Fill value to 50% by pressing Shift+5, 
and then I'll create a new comp by clicking

02:45: on the little page icon, and I'll 
name this guy Fill blend, like so.

02:50: Make sure Visibility and Appearance 
are turned on, and click OK. All right.

02:54: So, for the sake of comparison, here is the 50% 
opaque version of Vivid Light, which looks

03:00: frankly awful, and here's what happens when 
we leave Opacity altogether alone, leave it

03:05: set to 100%, and we just reduce the Fill value 
to 50% instead; we get a much better effect.

03:12: And this is true for all of the blend modes 
that make up the Fill Opacity eight. All right.

03:18: Let's see how things fare with Linear Light.

03:20: I'll go ahead and click on the little page 
in front of Opacity blend in order to switch

03:24: back to that layer comp, and you can see the 
Opacity is set to 50%; the Fill value is set to 100%.

03:29: I'll press Shift+Plus to advance to the Linear 
Light mode, and I'll drop down to this little

03:34: update icon at the bottom of the Layer Comps 
panel, and I'll click on it, and then I'll

03:39: click on the page in front of Fill blend.

03:42: In this case, we're seeing an Opacity of 100%, and a 
Fill of 50%, so those values are being retained for us.

03:48: That's why Layer Comps 
are oftentimes so great.

03:51: And I'll press Shift+Plus to advance to Linear 
Light, and I'll update that comp by clicking

03:55: on the update icon. All right.

03:57: So here is Linear Light set to 50% Opacity; not 
quite as bad as Vivid Light, but bad enough.

04:02: We have all kinds of low 
saturation transitions.

04:05: It just looks like a washed out effect, whereas
if I click in front of Fill blend, we have

04:10: these wonderfully saturated colors, and we have 
some hotspots, and nice transitions as well.

04:16: All right,

04:16: now let's see how things 
fair with the Difference mode.

04:19: I want to save Hard Mix for last.

04:21: So I'll click in front of Opacity blend in 
order to make it active again, and I'll press

04:25: Shift+Alt+E, or Shift+Option+E on the Mac, in 
order to apply Difference. And then I'll update

04:31: that layer comp, and then I'll click in 
front of Fill blend to make it active.

04:35: Press Shift+Alt+E, or Shift+Option+E on the 
Mac, in order to switch to the Difference mode,

04:39: and I'll click on the update 
icon to update that comp as well.

04:43: So this is a 50% opaque 
version of the Difference mode.

04:47: Basically what we're doing is half 
inverting the colors, and that's it.

04:50: So it really looks like nothing more than 
we didn't have the courage to go with a

04:54: higher Opacity value, whereas if I switch to 
Fill blend, you can see we've got all kinds

05:00: of contrast going on.

05:02: We're not just half inverting the colors; we're 
doing something entirely different. All right.

05:07: Now you have to see Hard Mix.

05:08: I'll go ahead and click in front of Opacity 
blend again, and I'll Shift+Alt+L, or Shift+Option+L

05:13: on the Mac, to switch to the Hard 
Mix mode. Couldn't look worse.

05:17: We've just basically taken that rotten effect, 
and overlaid it on top of the original model

05:22: at 50% level of Opacity.

05:25: I'll go ahead and update the layer comp by 
clicking on the update icon, and now I'll

05:29: click in front of Fill blend, and I'll press 
Shift+Alt+L, or Shift+Option+L on the Mac, in

05:34: order to switch to Hard Mix, with a 
Fill value of 50%, and it looks great!

05:40: I'm going to go ahead and 
update that comp as well.

05:42: And really, honestly it looks so great that 
it doesn't even look like a similar effect.

05:47: So just for the sake of comparison; I'm not 
sure you need this, but I'll click in front

05:50: of Opacity blend.

05:52: That's Hard Mix with an Opacity value of 50%, 
and this is Hard Mix with a Fill value of 50%.

05:58: Now, it's interesting to note that you 
can take that Fill value pretty high.

06:01: I'll press Shift+9 in order to crank that 
Fill value up to 90%, and it's very different

06:07: than Shift+0 for 100%.

06:10: So backing up to 90% Fill, we start smoothing off those 
edges; we no longer have the jagged transitions.

06:16: This is a Fill of 80%, this is a 
Fill of 70%, and this is a Fill of 60%.

06:21: You can take it quite low as well.

06:22: I'll press Shift+2 to take 
the Fill value down to 20%.

06:25: I'll go ahead and update that guy, and for 
the sake of comparison, I'll click in front

06:29: of Opacity blend, and press the 2 key to take 
the Opacity value down to 20%, and update that

06:35: layer comp as well.

06:36: So this is 20% opaque Hard Mix.

06:38: This is 20% Fill combined 
with Hard Mix. All right.

06:42: I'm going to go ahead and hide Layer Comps 
there, and I'm going to hide the sunlight

06:46: layer as well, and click on this 
top model layer to select it.

06:49: Now, there is one last topic I want to 
touch on here, and that's layer effects.

06:53: We've seen how every single layer 
effect has blend modes associated with it.

06:57: So when you reduce the Opacity associated 
with the layer effect, are you changing the

07:01: equivalent of the Opacity value here inside 
the Layers panel, or are you changing Fill?

07:06: And the answer is you're changing Fill,
and let me demonstrate that to you.

07:10: I'm going to drop down to the black/white 
icon, and I'm going to choose Gradient, and that

07:15: will create a Gradient layer.

07:16: I'll click on the down-pointing arrowhead, 
and I'll switch it to Spectrum, which is that

07:19: rainbow gradient that ships along with Photoshop,
and we'll end up achieving this effect here.

07:24: Click OK, and now I'm going to change the 
blend mode to Hard Mix for this layer.

07:29: Looks terrible, of course; press the Escape key 
so that blend mode pop-up menu is no longer

07:33: active, and I'll press the 5 key to 
reduce the Opacity to 50%. All right.

07:38: Let's bring back Layer Comps. I'll click on 
Opacity blend. Not in front of it; just on

07:42: it, and I'll go ahead and update it, and then 
I'll press the 0 key to increase the Opacity

07:47: to 100%, and I'll press Shift+5 to reduce the 
Fill Opacity to 50%, and I'll click on Fill

07:54: blend -- don't click in front of it -- in order to 
make it active, and then click the update button.

07:59: So this is that gradient at 50% Opacity.

08:01: This is that gradient at 50% Fill.

08:04: So obviously we get a much smoother transition 
with 50% Fill combined with Hard Mix. All right.

08:09: I'm going to turn that layer off.

08:11: Let's see the same thing at 
work with a layer effect.

08:14: I'll click on the model layer, drop down to 
the fx icon, and choose Gradient Overlay, and

08:19: I'm going to set the Gradient to that same 
rainbow Spectrum, like so. I'll change

08:24: the blend mode to Hard Mix once again, and 
then I'll reduce the Opacity value to 50%.

08:30: And so you can see that the option that goes 
by the name Opacity when you're applying layer

08:35: effects is really that Fill Opacity value, at least 
where the Fill Opacity eight are concerned. All right.

08:42: So I'll go ahead and click OK in order to 
apply that effect, and that's how you work

08:47: with the Fill Opacity eight; eight special blend 
modes that work better with the Fill value than

08:53: they do with Opacity here inside Photoshop.


 ** Using the luminance-exclusion slider bars

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you yet another 
method for blending layers inside Photoshop.

00:05: And that's what are commonly known as the 
Blend If slider bars, but they are better

00:09: referred to by their function, 
which is luminance exclusion.

00:13: So the idea is this: using the luminance 
exclusion sliders, you can drop out pixels on the active

00:19: layer, or force through pixels from 
layers below, based on their luminance values.

00:24: And along the way, we are going to transform this 
blue moon into this absolute lunar explosion.

00:31: So let me start by showing 
you how the sliders work.

00:33: We'll turn on this gradient layer, and 
click on it as well to make it active.

00:37: You can see that it's a black 
to white to black gradient.

00:39: So white in the center; black on the sides.

00:42: I will double-click in an empty portion of 
layer to bring up the Layer Style dialog box.

00:46: and you can see these two 
sliders down here at the bottom.

00:49: This Layer controls the active layer. Underlying Layer 
controls the composite view of the underlying layers, plural.

00:56: So notice, if I go up to the This Layer slider, 
and I drag its white triangle over to left,

01:02: then I'm revealing the 
center portion of the gradient.

01:06: So in my case, I'm saying anything with the 
Luminance level of 110 or brighter, going all

01:10: the way up to 255 for white, 
will become transparent.

01:14: And anything that's 110 or darker will remain 
opaque, subject to the Blend Mode, and Opacity

01:19: and Fill settings.

01:20: I can also drop out dark colors by dragging 
this black triangle over to the right, and

01:26: you so you can see how those dark colors are dropping 
off on both the left and right sides of the gradient.

01:32: And so now we're left with a very small range 
of Luminance levels; only those pixels between

01:38: 70 and 110 are going to be visible.

01:40: All right, I will go ahead 
and reset those triangles.

01:43: Now let me show you how 
Underlying Layer works.

01:45: I will drag this white triangle,

01:47: let's say, all the way down the 50.

01:49: Now I am saying, any pixels that have a 
Luminance level of 50 or brighter on the underlying

01:55: layers -- plural, once again -- are going to 
force their way through, regardless of the

01:59: other blend settings.

02:01: And if I do the opposite here, I will go ahead 
and return the white triangle to 255, and take

02:06: the black triangle up to, say, something like 
70, then I'm saying anything with a Luminance

02:11: level of 70 or darker is 
forcing its way through.

02:14: Now you may look at this and say, all right; 
I guess that's pretty interesting, but here

02:18: I am revealing a hole in the 
center of this gradient. That's fine,

02:22: but we've got this continuous 
gradient, and this very hard edge.

02:26: So it's an immediate transition 
from opacity to transparency.

02:29: Well, if you take a close look at these triangles, you can 
see that there's a slit down the center of each one.

02:35: And what that's telling you is, if you press 
the Alt key, or the Option key on the Mac, you

02:39: can drag one half of the triangle away from the 
other in order to create smooth transitions.

02:45: So now I'm saying any pixels on the active 
layer that have Luminance levels between zero

02:49: and 110 are opaque.

02:52: Any pixels from 110 to 255 are growing progressively 
translucent until they ultimately disappear at white.

02:59: All right, I am going to go 
ahead and click the OK button,

03:02: so that you can see one more thing; here in 
CS6 you have this little indicator that's

03:07: telling you that you've applied advanced 
blending options, just so that you know what's going

03:11: on with the layer, because it can be confusing, since 
those options are otherwise concealed from us.

03:16: All right, now I am going to press the 
Backspace key to get rid of that gradient,

03:20: and I'll show you how I put 
together my composition.

03:22: I started by creating a new layer called blackness, and 
I went ahead and brushed in some black blobs there.

03:28: And that's because I wanted this lightning 
from the lightning ball layer to shine through.

03:32: Right now we are not seeing any sort of 
interaction between the layers, so I will click on lightning

03:36: ball, and I will press Shift+Alt+S, or Shift+Option+
S on the Mac, in order to apply the Screen mode.

03:41: Now that turns black, absolutely transparent, but the 
other dark colors are adding brightness to the image.

03:47: So I need to drop some of those dark colors 
out by double-clicking on an empty portion

03:52: of this layer to bring up 
the Layer Style dialog box.

03:54: I will tuck it over to the side 
here, so we can see what we are doing.

03:58: And I am going to drag this black, this 
layer triangle all the way up to 235. And you

04:03: have to do so manually, by the way; you can't 
enter numerical values, which is too bad, frankly,

04:09: but that's the way it works.

04:10: And so I am saying anything 235 
or darker is now transparent.

04:14: I want to create some fuzziness 
there, some smooth transitions,

04:18: so I will press the Alt key, or the Option 
key on the Mac, and drag the left half of this

04:22: black triangle to the left until I 
take that first value down to 140.

04:27: Now I want to force through the 
brightest pixels on the moon layer,

04:30: and I'll do that by pressing the Alt key 
right off the bat, the Option key on the Mac, and

04:35: dragging the left half of that 
white triangle all the way down to 20.

04:39: All right, now I will click 
OK to accept that change.

04:42: We need to bring back some more of the moon, 
so I will click on the background, and press

04:46: Control+Alt+J, or Command+Option+J on the Mac,
name this new layer moon, and click OK.

04:51: And then I will drag it on 
top of lightning ball, like so.

04:54: I want to start things off by 
masking away everything outside the moon,

04:57: and I am going to do so using a vector mask.

04:59: So I will drop down to the Add Layer 
Mask icon at the bottom of Layers panel,

05:03: and I will Control+Click here on the PC; 
that would be a Command+Click on the Mac.

05:08: Then click on the Vector mask thumbnail to 
select it, and drop down to the Shape tool

05:11: flyout menu, and select the Ellipse tool, and 
then change this first setting up here in

05:16: the Options bar from Shape to Path, and then 
you need to go over here to the Path operations

05:20: icon, and change this 
setting to Combine Shapes.

05:24: That way the moon will appear 
inside whatever ellipse you draw.

05:27: So we will go ahead and draw this big ellipse 
around the entire moon, like so, and I am using

05:32: the spacebar, of course, in order to 
register the ellipse around the moon.

05:37: And I might tuck things in just a little bit, 
so that I don't do too much of a dark edge.

05:41: And I will end up with is effect.

05:43: Now I want to add a little bit of feathering, 
so I will double-click on the Vector mask

05:47: thumbnail here inside the Layers panel to 
bring up the Properties panel, but that also

05:51: ends up deselecting the vector mask,
so I have to click on it again.

05:54: And now I will take the other Feather value 
up to 10 pixels, and press the Enter key, and

05:58: hide the Properties panel.

06:00: All right, now let's force through some of 
the tendrils of lightning by double-clicking

06:04: on an empty portion of the moon layer in 
order to bring up the Layer Style dialog box, and

06:09: I am going to press the Alt key, the Option 
key on the Mac, and drag the left half of this

06:13: white triangle associated with the Underlying Layers 
slider to 218 is what I am fishing around here for.

06:20: I finally got it. That looks good.

06:22: Now I will go ahead and click OK 
in order to accept that effect.

06:26: All right, now if you're working along with me, 
you will see that I have created this layer

06:29: called lens flare, go ahead and 
turn it on, and select it as well.

06:33: And what it is is it's a layer of black that I 
turned into a Smart Object, and then I applied

06:38: the Lens Flare filter, which is located, by 
the way, under the Filter menu; go to Render,

06:43: and its right there Lens Flare.

06:45: And you can check out my settings just by 
double-clicking on the words Lens Flare; that

06:49: will bring up the Lens Flare panel. So I 
position the center of the effect right about there;

06:54: very dinky preview inside this dialog box.

06:56: And I cranked up the Brightness value to 165%.

06:59: Go ahead and cancel out of 
there, because that's done.

07:02: I also created a gradient map layer that is 
clipped to the lens flare layer, and it's colorizing

07:07: the Lens Flare effect blue.

07:09: All right, the first thing we need to do to 
create some interaction here is press Shift+Alt+S,

07:13: or Shift+Option+S on the Mac, in order to switch to 
the Screen mode. Then I will go and double-click

07:18: on an empty portion of the layer.

07:20: You do not click on the thumbnail, by the way, 
because that would open the Smart Object.

07:24: And I want you to press the Alt key, or the 
Option key on the Mac, and drag the right half

07:29: of the black of This Layer triangle 
all the way up to 205, so right there.

07:35: And that drops away a huge range 
of dark pixels on this layer.

07:39: Then go ahead and click OK, and the final thing 
I did was to Shift+Click on blue map, so both

07:44: of these layers are selected,

07:46: and then I dragged them down, and dropped them below the 
moon layer in order to achieve this final effect.

07:52: All right, I am going to go ahead and press 
Shift+F in order to switch to full screen

07:56: mode, and zoom in on my artwork as well.

07:59: And that, friends, is how you take advantage 
of the most advanced blending options there

08:03: are inside Photoshop: the 
luminance exclusion slider bars.


 ** Color Range

00:00: Starting in this chapter, and continuing until 
the end of the course, we will be expending

00:05: every bit of our energy on Photoshop's advanced 
selection tools, starting with a command called Color Range.

00:12: Remember the Magic Wand? Sure you do.

00:15: Everyone knows the wand. Problem is, while 
it's easy to use, it delivers amateur results.

00:20: Adobe knew this very early on.

00:23: So a long, long time ago -- we 
are talking there early 1990s --

00:27: they created a feature to replace the Magic 
Wand, only they buried it, and they gave it

00:32: a weird name: Color Range,

00:34: like it's some kind of 
ranch with colorful cattle.

00:38: It's as if Adobe purposely made it

00:40: so no one would find it. 
No one, except you.

00:44: You use the command just like the Magic Wand.

00:46: You click any image to select colors;

00:49: ranges of colors, so I 
guess it's a great name.

00:52: But see, the unlike the Wand, Color 
Range makes its changes dynamically,

00:57: and it shows you a preview of what it's up to, and it 
renders its selections organically into the image.

01:03: It rocks!

01:04: I'll also show you the Quick Mask mode, 
which lets you edit a selection using brushes.

01:09: This is good stuff.

01:11: All you have to do is keep watching.


 ** Introducing the Color Range command

00:00: In this movie, I'll introduce you to Photoshop's 
best automated method for selecting images:

00:05: the Color Range command.

00:06: Now, because the command is a little tricky 
to understand at first, I'll explain it in

00:10: the context of the tool it was intended 
to replace, which is the Magic Wand.

00:15: I'll start by going to the Image menu, and 
choosing the Duplicate command, and I going

00:19: to call this duplicate image Magic Wand, and 
then press the Enter key, or the Return key

00:23: on the Mac, and zoom in as well.

00:25: This is a pretty straightforward photograph.

00:27: It features these light billowy clouds set 
against a fairly homogeneous blue background.

00:33: It does start a little dark on the top, and 
end a little light, but it's obvious where

00:37: the clouds begin and end.

00:40: So you might figure that the Magic Wand is 
perfectly suited to select these clouds.

00:44: So I'll go ahead and click and hold on the 
Quick Selection tool, and then select the Magic

00:49: Wand tool from the flyout menu.

00:51: Notice all of my default 
settings are in place.

00:53: You may recall that Tolerance is 
measured in Luminance levels,

00:56: so by default, Photoshop is going to select 
32 Luminance levels lighter, and 32 Luminance

01:01: levels darker than the Luminance of the 
click point on a channel by channel basis.

01:07: Anti-alias is turned on,

01:08: so we'll get those smoothed off edges.

01:11: Contiguous is also turned on, so the tool 
will select only adjacent pixels, meaning

01:16: that it's not going to jump the 
selection from one cloud to the other.

01:19: I'll go ahead and click inside the clouds to 
select them, and that selects about half the cloud.

01:24: Now, naturally, I could Shift+Click in order 
to add to the selection, but for purposes

01:28: of demonstration here, so we 
are comparing apples to apples,

01:32: I am going to create a single click selection, 
which means I need to increase my Tolerance value.

01:37: So I'll press the Enter key, or the Return 
key on the Mac, in order to highlight that

01:40: value, and I'll raise it all the way to 160.

01:43: Now, that doesn't have any effect on the existing 
selection, because Tolerance is a static setting

01:48: that affects the next selection 
outline I create. All right.

01:52: So I'll press Control+D, or Command+D on the Mac, 
to start over, and then I'll click right there

01:56: on the cloud, and that selects 
the whole thing, as you can see.

01:59: Then I'll Shift+Click on the 
smaller cloud to select it as well.

02:03: Now I'll jump the clouds to a new layer by 
pressing Control+Alt+J, or Command+Option+J on the Mac.

02:08: I'll name the layer clouds, and then 
I'll drag it to the top of the stack.

02:12: Notice that I have this 
gradient called red sky.

02:15: Its purpose is to help us gauge 
the quality of the selection.

02:18: So I'll go ahead and turn it on, and you can see that 
we have got a pretty rough selection indeed here.

02:23: Now, we can get rid of those blue edges by 
going up to the blend mode pop-up menu, and

02:28: switching it from Normal to Luminosity, 
and we end up with this result here.

02:32: However, while it was an 
easy selection to create,

02:35: I hazard to say, it's not the kind of thing I think 
any of us would have been proud to have made.

02:40: But it's not your fault.

02:41: The problem is you just happen 
to be using the wrong tool.

02:44: So I'll switch over to the original image, 
press the M key to go back to the Rectangular

02:48: Marquee tool, and now I'll go up to the 
Select menu, and choose the Color Range command.

02:53: If you loaded DekeKeys, you have got a keyboard 
shortcut of Control+Shift+Alt+G, or Command+Shift+Option+G

02:58: on a Mac; G being, of course, the second to 
last letter in the word range. All right.

03:02: So that brings up this dialog box, which is 
where a lot of folks get confused, because

03:06: this doesn't even look 
like a selection function.

03:09: But in fact, it works a lot 
like the Magic Wand tool.

03:12: If you move your cursor out into the image 
window, it turns into an eyedropper, and it

03:16: functions just like the Wand. In other words,
you click to set a key color, and then you

03:21: can see the selection starting to 
emerge here inside the dialog box.

03:26: So what we are seeing in this little preview 
here is a masked version of the selection.

03:31: Wherever the preview appears white, that region 
will be selected; wherever it appears black,

03:36: that area will not be selected.

03:37: And in fact, if I click OK at this point right now, I 
will generate a selection outline, as you can see.

03:44: All right. I'll press Control+D, or Command+D 
on a Mac, to deselect the image.

03:47: And then I'll go back up to the Select 
menu, and choose Color Range once again.

03:52: Now, notice that Photoshop is smart enough 
in order to load that key color, and that's

03:56: because I actually changed my foreground color 
when I clicked inside the cloud, and so Color

04:00: Range is always basing its initial 
selection on the foreground color.

04:05: Now, if you want to expand the selection, you 
can Shift+Click inside the image window, just

04:09: as you can with the Magic 
Wand tool. Also, get this --

04:12: I'll go ahead and click at the top 
of the cloud to reset the selection --

04:16: you can also Shift+Drag across the image, 
and notice, as you do, that your selection

04:21: will grow on the fly. All right,

04:23: but I'm looking for a single-click selection,

04:25: so I'll just click near the 
top of the cloud once again.

04:29: Notice this Fuzziness value;

04:30: like Tolerance, it's measured in 
Luminance levels, and by default, it's set to 40.

04:34: So Photoshop is going to select 40 Luminance 
levels brighter, and 40 Luminance levels darker

04:39: than the click point on a 
channel by channel basis.

04:43: The reason this option is called Fuzziness, 
and not Tolerance is because the selection

04:47: drops off over that luminance range.

04:50: So in other words, any Luminance levels that 
are very close to the Luminance of the click

04:54: point will be selected, and those that are farther 
away will drop off in terms of the selection.

05:01: So in other words, you get a gradual 
selection that represents the image organically.

05:06: Now let's say I want to 
select more of the image.

05:08: I would go ahead and increase that Fuzziness 
value, and you can see the clouds inside the

05:13: mask preview grow on the fly, and that's 
because Fuzziness, in addition to being better than

05:18: Tolerance in the first place, 
is also a dynamic control,

05:21: so you can see what value is going to work best for 
you, as opposed to just making stabs in the dark.

05:26: In my case, I came up with a value of 160; 
that same value I applied to the Magic Wand.

05:33: Now, another thing to notice is that the Color 
Range command automatically jumps the gaps.

05:37: In other words, it's always 
designed to select nonadjacent pixels.

05:41: Now, that's not always necessarily a good thing,
which is why we have this Localized Color

05:45: Clusters checkbox.

05:46: I'll go ahead and turn it on, and what it does 
is it limits the selection to a physical area

05:51: around your click point.

05:53: So notice, if I decrease the Range value, we are 
creating a kind of radial gradient inside the cloud.

05:59: Now, it's possible that I can find a Range 
value that will mostly select the first cloud,

06:04: and mostly not select the second cloud, but I 
have to say, this is a pretty flawed control.

06:09: I haven't found it to be very useful.

06:11: So what I typically do is just leave 
Localized Color Clusters turned off. All right;

06:16: now that we have generated a one click selection 
that looks awfully good here inside the dialog box --

06:21: and by the way, you can switch to the image 
if you want to see the image instead, and you

06:26: can switch the Selection Preview to Grayscale, 
which will show you the mask preview outside

06:31: in the larger image window. You 
can continue to Shift+Click in it.

06:35: You can also click or Shift+Click 
directly inside the dialog box.

06:38: Anyway, I am going to restore these items 
to their defaults, and click OK in order to

06:43: generate the selection outline. And now let's 
test its quality by pressing Control+Alt+J, or

06:49: Command+Option+J on Mac.

06:50: I'll name the layer clouds, click OK, drag 
it to the top of the stack, turn on the red

06:54: sky layer, and then change the blend mode for 
the clouds layer from Normal to Luminosity,

07:00: and we end up with this effect here.

07:03: So just for the sake of comparison, here is 
what we got with the Magic Wand tool, which

07:07: everybody considers to be a 
really easy tool to use,

07:11: and here's the results we got, with no more 
work, using the Color Range command. And that,

07:16: folks, is how you use Color Range to generate 
credible, organic selections here inside

07:21: Photoshop.


 ** Selecting a complex image with Color Range

00:00: In this movie, I am going to show you how to 
lay down a base selection using the Color

00:04: Range command, and we're going to ultimately 
take this articulated hadrosaur skeleton,

00:09: and move it into this new background in 
order to create this final composition.

00:14: Now, I realize this is a fairly ridiculous piece 
of artwork; however, it's rendered impeccably.

00:21: So I've been able to select, and ultimately 
mask this skeleton with flawless precision.

00:25: All right, I am going to switch 
back to my dinosaur photograph.

00:28: And if you're working along with me, go ahead 
and tap the D key to establish your default

00:33: colors, because after all, the Color Range 
command goes ahead and bases its initial selection

00:39: on that foreground color.

00:40: Then go up to the Select menu, and choose the 
Color Range command, or once again if you

00:44: loaded dekeKeys, you can press mash your fist G, and 
that'll go ahead and bring up the dialog box here.

00:50: Now, I've got my Fuzziness 
value cranked way to high.

00:52: I am going to go ahead and take it down to 40.

00:55: Now we could click, and Shift+Click, and Shift+
Drag inside this skeleton, but there's so much

01:00: variation in luminance going on,

01:02: that it's going to take a fair amount of time and 
effort, whereas the background is fairly homogeneous,

01:08: so I'll go ahead and click in the upper left 
region, like so, and then I'll Shift+Click down

01:12: left, below the creature's jaw.

01:14: And now if I keep an eye on the mask preview 
here inside the dialog box, I can begin to

01:19: gauge a Fuzziness value 
that's going to work out for me.

01:22: But you know what? Might as well gauge that 
Fuzziness value inside the entire image window.

01:27: So I'll change the Selection Preview to Grayscale,
so we can better see what's going on, and then

01:31: I'll click inside the Fuzziness value, and 
press Shift+up arrow five times in a row to

01:36: raise that Fuzziness to 90.

01:38: Now, you'll notice some little edges going 
on inside of the eyes, and the mouth, and the

01:43: nose, and so forth.

01:45: That's the function of the auto-sharpening 
that was applied by the camera,

01:48: and if I go ahead and zoom in by pressing 
Control+Plus, or Command+Plus on the Mac, I can

01:52: try Shift+Clicking on those edges to see if 
I can get rid of them. And that looks like

01:57: that might have worked pretty well.

01:58: All right, now I am going to zoom back out.

02:01: It'd be wonderful if I could get rid of this 
line, or seam, or whatever this thing is, but

02:05: if I Shift+Click on it, notice that 
that selects way too much of the animal.

02:10: Fortunately, you have one level of undo, which you can 
access by pressing Control+Z, or Command+Z on the Mac.

02:17: And by the way, you'll see the preview flash 
inside the dialog box, because when you have

02:21: the Control key down, or the Command key on a 
Mac, you see the image instead of the mask,

02:26: but as soon as you release Control or 
Command, you go back to the mask preview.

02:29: All right, now at this point, I am noticing 
that I am selecting too much inside the face,

02:34: so I could press the Alt key, or the Option 
key on the Mac, and click in that cheek.

02:39: I could even Alt+Drag or Option+Drag along 
the cheek, but if I do, there is a very good

02:43: chance I'll get this error message.

02:44: In fact, I'd say the chances are 100%, because 
here it is, and it's telling me that I've

02:50: subtracted so many key colors 
that I am down to just one.

02:54: So I'll go ahead and click OK, and Photoshop 
updates my preview to show me that I've barely

02:59: selected anything.

03:00: Again, I'll press Control+Z, or Command+Z on 
the Mac, to restore my previous selection.

03:06: And I'll just go ahead and press the Shift 
key, and drag behind the dinosaur, and then

03:10: up over its head, and over to the other side, 
just to make sure I've gotten as many colors

03:15: selected as possible.

03:16: Now, notice what just happened.

03:18: I am going to press Control+Z, or Command+Z on 
a Mac, to undo that change, because I want

03:23: you to keep your eye on, not only the big mask 
preview, but also little one inside the dialog box.

03:30: Notice, as I Shift+Drag inside the image, 
the preview in the dialog box updates.

03:35: However, the one inside the image 
window doesn't update until I release.

03:40: So that's something to bear in mind as 
you're working inside this dialog box.

03:42: And you know, I can't help but think I am 
just going to far with this, so I'm going

03:46: to press Control+Z, or Command+Z on the Mac, 
to undo the addition of those key colors.

03:50: Now, of course -- I'll go ahead and 
move this guy off to the side here --

03:54: we want to select the hadrosaur; 
not the background.

03:57: So go ahead and turn on the Invert checkbox 
in order to invert the mask,which is going

04:02: to reverse the selection.

04:04: Then click OK in order to create that 
initial selection with the Color Range command.

04:10: Now at this point, we have spent a fair 
amount of time generating the selection.

04:13: It may not be exactly what we want; in fact, 
I am quite confident it's not, but what I

04:18: recommend you do, after creating a complex 
selection like this, is switch to the Channels

04:23: panel, and then drop down to this icon at the bottom 
of the panel that says Save selection as channel.

04:29: Go ahead and Alt+Click on it, or Option+Click 
on it on a Mac, and because you had Alt or

04:34: Option down, you forced the 
display of the New Channel dialog box.

04:37: Let's call this guy base selection, and then 
click OK in order to save the selection as

04:43: what's known as an alpha channel.

04:45: And then, because you've added a channel to the image,
you can no longer save it in the JPEG format.

04:50: So go ahead and press Control+S, or Command+S 
on the Mac. Because JPEG is not an option,

04:56: that forces the display of 
the Save As dialog box.

04:59: I am going to switch this image over to the 
TIFF format, which is the format I recommend

05:04: you use if your image contains alpha 
channels, but does not contain layers.

05:09: And then I'll just go ahead and rename this 
image base selection; I'll go ahead and include

05:13: it for you as well.

05:15: Make sure the alpha 
channels checkbox is turned on;

05:17: that's very important.

05:18: Then click on the Save button, make sure that 
the LZW option is turned on here inside Image

05:24: Compression, and then go ahead and 
click OK in order to save off that file.

05:29: And that way, you can press Control+D, or Command+
D on the Mac, to deselect the image, and you're

05:34: fine, because everything about that 
selection is now saved as an alpha channel.

05:40: And so there you have it.

05:41: That's how you lay down a base selection with 
the Color Range command, and save your selection

05:46: here inside Photoshop.


 ** Refining a selection in the Quick Mask mode

00:00: In this movie, we will evaluate the selection 
that we created in the previous one, and then

00:05: we'll refine it inside the Quick Mask mode.

00:07: So, assuming that you went ahead and saved 
your selection as an alpha Channel, make sure

00:11: you are seeing the Channels panel onscreen, 
and then click on that alpha channel, which

00:16: I called base selection, and you will see your 
selection outline represented as a mask.

00:21: So anywhere you see a white pixel, 
that's a 100% selected pixel.

00:26: Anywhere where you see a black pixel, that 
pixel is 0% selected, and any shade of gray

00:32: is some degree of selection in between.

00:35: Now, you might ask, well, does that mean that 
a selection outline is resolution dependent,

00:39: the way the image is?

00:41: And the answer is yes.

00:43: Each and every pixel has a 
selection value associated with it.

00:47: Now, to put the mask in play, you need to 
convert it back to a selection outline, and you do

00:52: that by pressing the Control key, or the Command 
key on the Mac, and clicking on that alpha

00:56: channel, and that goes ahead and selects each 
and every pixel based on it's Luminance, from

01:02: black for deselection, to 
white for absolute selection.

01:06: Now you can switch back to the RGB 
image, and the marching ants remain intact.

01:10: Now, just in case you have any concern about 
converting from a selection outline to an

01:15: alpha channel, and then back to a selection 
outline, because after all, normally these kinds

01:21: of things inside Photoshop are destructive 
modifications potentially; in this case, that's not so.

01:28: The selection outline and the mask are exactly 
the same thing, because when you create a selection

01:33: outline, Photoshop is calculating the 
selection as a mask in the background.

01:38: All right, now let's go ahead and move the 
selection into its final composition, and I'll

01:43: do that the easy way by pressing Control+C, or 
Command+C on the Mac, to copy the dinosaur,

01:49: then I'll switch over to my Planets file here,
and I'll press Control+V, or Command+V on the

01:54: Mac, in order to paste that 
selection as a new layer.

01:58: So you can see if you switch over to the Layers 
panel, that indeed we do have a new layer

02:02: at the top of this stack, which is great. 
Unfortunately, it's not a great layer.

02:07: We have got all this bright green fringe around 
the edge of the skeleton, and then we are missing

02:12: whole sections of skeleton up here along the 
bridge of the nose, and the top to the cheekbone,

02:18: and then finally, we still have this darn 
line, and a bunch of junk over here on the

02:23: left-hand side, and the bottom of the image as 
you can see here if I scroll down as well.

02:27: So we need to do some work.

02:29: So press Control+Z, or Command+Z on the Mac, to 
undo the addition of that layer, and I will

02:34: switch back to my selected dinosaur, and now 
let's make some modifications to the selection

02:39: in the Quick Mask mode.

02:41: You can you get to the Quick Mask mode by 
clicking on this icon toward the bottom of

02:44: the toolbox, or you can press the Q key.

02:47: So the icon takes you in, the icon takes you back out;
pressing the Q key takes you in and out as well.

02:54: Now, when you first enter the Quick Mask mode,
you are going to see the mask represented

02:59: as what's know as a rubylith overlay, and then 
everything about the image that's selected

03:04: will appear normally.

03:06: Well, the problem with the ruby overlay for our 
purposes is that our image already contains

03:11: a lot of warm colors.

03:13: So if we are going to get any work done here, 
we need to change that overlay color, and you

03:17: can do that in one of two ways.

03:19: You can double-click on the Quick Mask mode 
icon here at the bottom of the toolbox, but

03:23: if you do that, you will end up exiting the 
Quick Mask mode, which is a pain in the neck.

03:27: I am going to show you an 
alternate way to work.

03:30: Switch over to the Channels panel, and you'll see 
Quick Mask represented as a temporary alpha channel.

03:36: Double-click on its thumbnail to bring up 
the Quick Mask Options dialog box, then click

03:41: on the color, and let's choose a Hue value 
that's complementary to what we have so far.

03:45: I recommend 180 degrees, which is Cyan, and 
then click OK, and you can change the Opacity

03:51: level as well, but I think 50% is fine.

03:55: Then click OK, and now we can 
really see what we were doing.

03:58: So anything that's lighting up bright blue 
here is masked, or deselected, and anything

04:03: that's looking like normal dinosaur 
skeleton is unmasked, or selected.

04:08: All right, now let's go ahead and 
paint away some obviously bad details.

04:11: I am going to switch to my Brush tool, which 
I can get by pressing the B key, and then I

04:16: will right-click inside the image window, and 
I am going to raise the Size value, let's

04:20: say, to 30 pixels maybe.

04:22: I definitely want the Hardness to be 100%, 
and then I will press the Enter key, or the

04:27: Return key on a Mac, to hide that panel.

04:29: Now, you may think that you need to paint in 
blue, or transparency, and somehow those would

04:35: appear as colors at the bottom of the toolbox.
Instead, you paint with black and white.

04:40: When you paint with white, which is currently my 
foreground color, you paint in selection,

04:46: meaning that you paint 
transparency into this Quick Mask overlay.

04:51: I don't want that, so I will press Contrl+Z, or 
Command+Z on the Mac, to undo that change.

04:55: If I press the X key, so my foreground color 
is black, and I start painting in the image,

05:00: you can see I am now painting in the mask.

05:03: That is to say, I am painting 
in the Quick Mask overlay.

05:05: All right, so I will press Control+Z, 
Command+Z on the Mac, to undo that change as well.

05:10: Here is what I want to do.

05:11: I want to paint a straight line along this crease, or 
whatever it is right here, in order to mask it away.

05:17: So I will click on one side of the line, right 
next to the skeleton, like so, and then I will

05:22: press the Shift key, and click right under 
the jaw in order to paint a straight line

05:27: between those two points, and then I will 
click at this location above the jaw, and

05:33: I will press Control+0, or Command+0 on the Mac, 
to zoom out just a little bit, and I will press

05:37: the Shift key, and click over here 
on the far left side of the image.

05:41: All right. Finally, we want to get rid of some 
of this garbage along the left-hand side, and

05:45: at the bottom of the mask as well.

05:47: So go ahead and select the Lasso tool, which 
you can get by pressing the L key, and press

05:52: the Alt key, or the Option key on the Mac. Keep 
that key down, and just go ahead and surround

05:57: the image, like so, and then come back in from 
the pasteboard around like this, and click

06:04: your way around the nose of the dinosaur, and 
up to about here, and then, when you are done,

06:09: release the Alt key, or the Option key on the 
Mac, and Photoshop will go ahead and generate

06:14: the polygonal selection outline.

06:16: And now, because black is my foreground color, 
I will press Alt+Backspace, or Option+Delete

06:20: on the Mac, in order to fill the 
selection in with that Quick Mask overlay.

06:25: And now I will press Control+D, or Command+
D on the Mac, to deselect the image.

06:30: And now, if you like, you can convert the 
temporary mask back to a selection outline by pressing

06:35: the Q key in order to exit the Quick Mask 
mode. And just so we can keep track of our

06:39: work here, I am going to save off another 
alpha channel by dropping down to the Save

06:43: selection as channel icon, and Alt+Clicking 
or Option+Clicking on it, and then I will

06:47: call this selection QM refinement, and click OK, 
and now we have managed to, once again, back up

06:54: our work. And that's how you go about 
loading an alpha channel as a selection outline,

06:59: and then refining that 
selection in the Quick Mask mode.


 ** Viewing a mask with or without its image

00:00: In this movie, we'll apply some more 
modifications to the selection outline in the Quick Mask

00:05: mode, and along the way, I'll show you how 
to view the Quick Mask along with the image,

00:09: as we've seen so far, as well as on its own.

00:12: I have still got my selection outline intact,

00:15: so I'll press the Q key to enter the Quick 
Mask mode, and at this point, it's a little

00:19: bit hard to tell what's going on.

00:20: I don't really know which areas need to be 
painted away, and which areas need to stay,

00:25: so I am going to turn off the RGB image, 
and view the Quick Mask independently.

00:30: So if you're working along with me, switch 
over to the Channels panel, and notice that

00:34: the Quick Mask is active, as well as visible, 
whereas the RGB image, and all of its channels

00:40: are visible, but inactive.

00:42: To make them invisible, just click on the 
eyeball in front of RGB, and that will show

00:47: you your selection outline as a 
standard black and white mask.

00:51: So everything that's masked appears black; everything 
that's unmasked, and therefore selected, appears white.

00:57: Now, there is also a keyboard shortcut for 
showing and hiding the full color image, and

01:02: that's the Tilde key, which is the key just to 
the left of the 1 key on an American keyboard.

01:08: So Tilde shows me the RGB image, and then 
pressing Tilde again hides the image.

01:14: Now, at this point, I obviously need to 
increase the contrast of my mask, and I'm going to do

01:18: so using the levels command.

01:21: So I'll press Control+L, or Command+L on the Mac, in 
order to invoke a static application of Levels.

01:27: You can't apply adjustment 
layers to masks inside Photoshop.

01:31: I'll click in the black point value, and notice 
that we've got a kind of spike of dark colors

01:37: over here on the left-hand 
side of the histogram.

01:40: Let's move the black point to the right of 
those dark colors by pressing Shift+up arrow

01:43: a couple of times to set 
the black point value to 20.

01:47: Next, I'll select my white Eyedropper tool 
over here on the right-hand side of the dialog

01:52: box, and I'll click on one of the darker pixels in 
the cheekbone there in order to make it white.

01:57: And if you see some gray values hanging in 
there, then click again to try and see if

02:01: you can get rid of them.

02:03: Ultimately, you should come up with a white 
point value of 160, so that we are clipping

02:07: all of this stuff away.

02:09: Now go ahead and click on the OK button in order 
to increase the contrast of that mask. All right.

02:15: That's a pretty big modification, so I am going to 
go ahead and save my changes as an alpha channel.

02:20: Another way to save your Quick Mask edits 
as alpha channels is to go ahead and drag

02:25: that Quick Mask item at the bottom of the 
Channels panel, and drop it onto the little

02:29: page icon, and that will 
create an unnamed alpha channel.

02:33: If you want to name the channel as you create 
it, then press the Alt key, or the Option key

02:37: on the Mac, and drag Quick Mask, and drop it 
onto the page icon, and you'll see the Duplicate

02:43: Channel dialog box.

02:45: And I'll call this channel Levels enhancement, 
and then I'll press the Enter key, or the Return

02:50: key on the Mac, to create that channel.

02:52: All right, now I am going to press the Q key 
to exit the Quick Mask mode, and convert the

02:56: mask to a selection outline, and because I've 
already backed up the selection, I'll press

03:01: Control+D, or Command+D on the Mac, to deselect the 
image, because I want to show you something else.

03:06: When you're working inside of an alpha channel, 
for example, I'll go ahead and click on Levels

03:10: enhancement to select it,

03:11: you also have the option of hiding or displaying 
the full-color image, and once again, you do

03:16: so by clicking in the eye column in front 
of RGB, or you can just press the Tilde key.

03:21: So Tilde will show the image, and then 
pressing Tilde again will hide it.

03:25: Now, what's interesting about this is, each 
one of the alpha channels has its own overlay

03:30: color associated with it.

03:32: For example, if I press on the base selection 
channel, and then press the Tilde key, you can

03:37: see that I have a red overlay, and that's 
because I created this channel before I changed

03:41: my Quick Mask color, whereas if I click on 
QM refinement, and then press the Tilde key,

03:47: you can see that by this 
point, I had switched to Cyan.

03:50: And you can assign a different color 
to each one of your alpha channels.

03:53: I'll switch to Levels 
enhancement, and then press the Tilde key.

03:57: It appears cyan right now, but if I want to 
change its color, I just double-click on the

04:01: thumbnail in order to bring up the Channel 
Options dialog box, and I click on the color

04:06: swatch, and let's say I decide to make this 
color a bright green by dialing in a Hue

04:10: value of 120 degrees. Then I'll click OK 
twice in order to apply that modification.

04:17: And that's how you view any kind of mask, with 
or without the full-color image, here inside

04:22: Photoshop.


 ** Painting directly inside an alpha channel

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to hand-paint 
the mask to create the final selection. And

00:04: you know what? Rather than switching back 
and forth between the selection outline and

00:09: the Quick Mask mode, we might as 
well edit our last channel directly.

00:13: So I'm going to go a head and click on Levels 
enhancement, which is the most recent version

00:17: of this selection, and there's some 
obvious stuff that I can paint away here.

00:21: I'll go ahead and press the B key to switch 
to the Brush tool, and I'll press the D key

00:26: in order to establish my default colors; that 
is, white as the foreground color, and black

00:31: as the background color.

00:33: And I'm still working 
with that hard-edged brush.

00:35: I'll go and press right bracket 
key a couple times to make it bigger,

00:38: and then I'll paint away this line, and I'll click 
here in order to get rid of some of this stuff.

00:43: You're often better of clicking, instead of 
paintin,g by the way, because if you start

00:47: painting along an edge, it's very possible 
you'll do this number, and ruin the edge.

00:53: Anyway, I'll press Control+Z, or Command+Z on a 
Mac, and paint over here in some of these

00:57: regions that are more 
obvious from this far away.

01:01: And then I'm going to zoom in on this region 
around the eye, and I'm going to reduce the

01:05: size of my brush by pressing left bracket 
key, and click along the bottom of the eye,

01:10: like so, then paint away some of the 
other garbage that I see around and about.

01:14: And I want to click along these details, paint right 
up to here, click, and then click on this junk.

01:21: All right, let's go ahead 
and zoom out a little bit.

01:23: Here's the detail that I can paint away. Obviously this 
edge along the bottom of the nose needs to get lost,

01:28: so I'll start by clicking there, and then 
I'll click here, and Shift+Click along this bad

01:33: edge, and you just want to make sure that 
you keep your brush away from the good edge.

01:37: And the Shift+Clicking, by the way, of course, 
establishes a straight line between the click

01:42: and Shift+Click points.

01:44: All right, I'll go ahead and paint that garbage,
paint away this is well, and I'm just going

01:49: to have to kind of sail along here.

01:51: I'm just tossing the 
image with the Hand tool.

01:53: This looks like it needs to leave, so I'll 
Shift+Click around here, taking care to stay

01:58: away from the edge when I'm 
doing the Shift+Clicking.

02:01: And maybe click right at that location,
click here, Shift+Click here maybe;

02:06: this is a little dangerous what I am 
doing, but it'll probably work out okay.

02:10: And when in doubt, just click next to an edge.

02:12: And we will clean up some of these other edges 
in just a moment, when we view both the image

02:16: and the mask at the same time.

02:18: I'm going to press the X key to switch my 
foreground color to black, and click right

02:22: at that location, reduce the size of my brush, 
and click here, because we've got some stray

02:27: pixels outside of what should be 
the deselected region of the image.

02:32: I'll increase the size of my brush; press 
the X key to switch the foreground color back

02:36: to white, and paint that stuff away.

02:39: And then I'll go ahead and continue down 
the dinosaurs' back, paint this stuff away,

02:43: this needs to go;

02:44: this stuff needs to go as well.

02:46: So it's a lot of hand editing.

02:48: There's other techniques that are available 
to you, but for this specific image, giving

02:52: the mask some meticulous 
attention is the best way to go.

02:56: I'll press the X key to switch to my 
foreground color to black, and paint that out of there,

03:00: press X again to switch to 
foreground color to white.

03:03: You get the idea, but it must be done,
so I am going to continue here.

03:06: We've got some bad stuff out here in the 
background, so I'll reduce my brush size, press the X

03:11: key to switch back to black, click these 
guys out of the way, press the X key to switch

03:16: to white, paint that guy 
out of the way as well.

03:19: Looks like we have some garbage that needs 
to be cleaned up right along this edge, and

03:24: at this point we're all the way down in the 
bottom right corner of the image looking at

03:28: the dinosaur's spine.

03:29: I'll a press X key, and click these details away, 
and then click inside of this region as well.

03:36: All right, so looks like we're doing a pretty 
good job, but I need to now display the image

03:40: to see if the edges are 
where they are supposed to be.

03:43: So I'll press the Tilde key in 
order to bring back those edges.

03:46: You don't need to worry about these little 
details; notice there is going to be some

03:50: color fringing at some point,

03:52: but we will take care of those problems using a couple 
of automated techniques when we modify the layer mask.

03:58: However, this area is the problem 
we need to deal with right now.

04:01: So I'll increase the size of my brush, my 
foreground color is black, which means I'm

04:04: painting in transparency in 
this Quick Mask display here.

04:09: So even though we're not in a Quick Mask mode, 
Photoshop calls this the Quick Mask display.

04:14: All right, so I've now made my way 
to the top of the dinosaur's head.

04:17: I'll paint away this stuff right there, and 
I need to paint away some of this garbage

04:23: at the top of the brow.

04:24: And so I'll just click, and maybe occasionally 
Shift+Click as well, in order to add some straight lines.

04:30: I'm just trying to do the best job 
I can in the least amount of time.

04:34: It does get to be a little painful, but you know, 
put on some music, listen to the radio; whatever.

04:40: It's Zen, don't you know?

04:42: All right, so I'll go 
ahead and paint this stuff.

04:44: I think I painted too far out there, so I 
will press X key and paint that back in.

04:49: And then let's just make our 
way down to the animal's snout.

04:52: We do have some edge fringing once again,
but we'll take care of that later.

04:56: This is actually looking pretty darn good, 
so I'll press Control+0, or Command+0 on a Mac,

05:01: to zoom all the way out, so I can take in my 
entire image, and then I'll press the Tilde

05:06: key in order to view the mask on its own.

05:09: All right, so we're done painting.

05:10: I'll press M key to switch back to the 
Rectangle Marquee tool, just to make sure that I don't

05:14: accidentally paint inside the image.

05:16: And this is no longer the Levels 
enhancement; this is now the final mask.

05:20: So I'll double-click on the name of this 
channel, and change it to final mask, like so,

05:25: and then I'll switch to the RGB image. And that, 
friends, is how you modify an alpha channel

05:30: directly, while taking 
advantage of the Quick Mask display.

05:33: In the next movie, we'll select the 
dinosaur, and add it to the layered composition.


 ** Correcting fringes around a masked layer

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to bring the 
skeleton into the planet's composition, complete

00:04: with the layer mask, and then we will modify 
the layer mask using a couple of really great

00:09: automated techniques.

00:11: So here I am looking at 
the full-color photograph.

00:14: I'll load my final mask as a selection outline 
by switching to the Channels panel, and then

00:19: pressing the Control key, or the Command key 
on the Mac, and clicking on final mask.

00:24: Then what you want to do is 
switch over to the Layers panel.

00:27: Now I could press Control+C, or Command+C on a Mac, 
and then switch over to the planet's composition,

00:32: and press Control+V, or Command+V be on a Mac, 
but that gives me a static layer, with all of

00:38: of the pixels outside of that selection 
outline transparent, which provides me with scant

00:43: editing opportunities.

00:44: For example, I need to get rid of this edge fringing, 
and there's no good way to do that without a mask.

00:50: So I will press Control+Z, or Command+Z on a Mac, to undo 
that change, and I'll switch back to my dinosaur.

00:56: I'll double-click on the background in order 
to convert it to a layer, and I'll name that

01:00: layer hadrosaur, and then press 
Enter key, or the Return key on a Mac.

01:04: And now I'll convert the selection to a layer 
mask by dropping down to the Add layer mask

01:09: icon at the bottom of Layers 
panel, and clicking on it.

01:12: Now what you want to do is, assuming that you 
have a selection tool active, right-click inside

01:17: the image window, and choose Duplicate Layer, and then 
switch the document to The planets.psd, and click OK.

01:25: Now at this point, were you to save your changes, 
you would want to save this image not in the

01:29: TIFF format, but in the native PSD format, 
because after all, you now have an independent

01:35: floating layer, and the PSD format 
is best suited to a layered image.

01:39: I will go ahead and switch over to The planets.psd, 
which now has the skeleton inside of it, complete

01:45: with a layer mask.

01:47: Now let's take care of that edge fringing.

01:49: There's fringing inside the bones, and around 
the skeleton, and we are going to deal with

01:54: that fringing in two different ways.

01:55: I'll click on the layer mask 
thumbnail to make it active; very important.

01:58: Then I'll press Control+0, or Command+0 on the 
Mac, to back out slightly, and I'll press the

02:04: L key to switch to the Lasso tool, and then 
I'll press and hold the Alt or Option key,

02:09: and I'll click in order to create a 
polygonal selection outline around all of the holes

02:14: inside of the dinosaur.

02:15: So notice that I'm tracing between the 
holes, and the outside of the dinosaur.

02:20: The one hole I'm skipping is that big hole 
inside the snout, and then when you get back

02:25: to the beginning of your selection, release 
the Alt key, or the Option key on the Mac, in

02:29: order to generate the selection outline.

02:32: I am going to go ahead and zoom on in here, 
so that we can better see what we are doing,

02:37: and what we need to do is enlarge the holes.

02:39: Now, if you were to Alt+Click or Option+Click 
on the layer mask thumbnail inside the Layers

02:43: panel, you'll see that the 
holes are represented as black.

02:47: So we need to enlarge the black areas, meaning 
that we need to apply the filter that increases

02:53: the size of black, which is Minimum,

02:56: so called because it's expanding the size of 
the minimum luminance level, which is black.

03:02: So that we can see what we are doing, I'll 
Alt+Click or Option+Click on that layer mask

03:05: thumbnail again, make sure it's selected, 
and then go up to the Filter menu, choose

03:10: Other, and choose Minimum, or if you loaded 
dekeKeys, you have a keyboard shortcut of Shift+F12.

03:17: By default, the Radius value is set to 1 pixel.

03:19: That's as much as we want.

03:20: If we go any higher than that, you'll see 
that you expand the holes way too far.

03:25: So 1 turns out to be exactly what we want, 
and if I click at this location here, so I

03:30: can see the hole inside 
of the dialog box preview,

03:33: if I click and hold, it 
used to be a little smaller.

03:36: If I release, you can see that it grows ever so 
slightly, just enough to fill in those fringes.

03:41: Then I'll click OK to accept that change.

03:45: Now to deal with the outside edges, and the 
edge inside of that snout, and I am going

03:49: to approach those edges a little differently, 
because they require a more finessed approach.

03:54: So I'll start by going up to the Select menu, 
and choosing the Inverse command, or you can

03:59: press Control+Shift+I, Command+Shift+I on a Mac. 
And that way the holes are no longer selected,

04:05: and the outside edges are.

04:06: Now, this approach involves a couple of steps.

04:08: Step number one is to go up to the Filter menu, 
choose Blur, and then choose Gaussian Blur.

04:15: And I'm going to take my Radius value up to 2 pixels, 
and you'll see that turns the fringes into halos.

04:20: If I click at this location, that centers 
that portion of the mask inside the dialog box

04:25: preview. I'll click and hold to show the before 
version, and I will release to show you the after version.

04:31: What that does is it feathers the edges, 
so that we can slip them back and forth using

04:36: a brightness modification.

04:39: Now I'll click OK.

04:40: Step number two is to press Control+L, or Command+L 
on the Mac, in order to bring up the Levels

04:46: dialog box, and now I am going to increase 
the black point value by clicking inside of

04:51: it, and pressing Shift+up arrow several times, 
and as I do so, you can see that edge move

04:56: inward. And I'm going to go ahead and zoom 
in a little bit more, so that I can continue

05:00: to track my changes, and I found that taking 
the black point value up to 200 ended up doing

05:07: the trick. And then I'll tab over to the white 
point value, and press Shift+down arrow a couple

05:12: of times to take it down to 235, which scoots 
the inside edges out just a little bit, but

05:18: really what it's doing 
is firming up the edges.

05:21: And that takes care of our fringing.

05:23: I'll go ahead and click OK in order to accept 
that change, and then press Control+D in order

05:28: to deselect the image.

05:30: Now, you may wonder why I took two different 
approaches for the inside and the outside

05:33: edges, and this is why:

05:35: the second approach, Gaussian Blur combined 
with levels, ends up rounding off corners.

05:41: So I've got this little wedge 
right here that wants to come out.

05:44: I'll Alt+Click or Option+Click around it with 
the Lasso tool, and then black happens be my

05:49: foreground color,

05:49: so I will press Alt+Backspace, or Option+
Delete on the Mac, in order to fill it in.

05:54: Then I'll click inside the image to deselect it.

05:56: I will Alt+Click around here in order to select 
this little detail, and I'll go ahead and release,

06:02: and press Alt+Backspace, or Option+Delete 
on a Mac, in order to fill it in this well.

06:07: And you can deal with as 
many of those as you want to.

06:10: You don't really have to worry about it too 
much, quite frankly, because these are single

06:13: pixel problems, and they probably won't render 
in print, or really any medium for that matter.

06:19: Now, this area inside the hole does not have 
rounded corners, because we applied the minimum

06:23: filter, but we do have some problem edges.

06:26: So I'll press the B key to switch to the Brush 
tool, and paint away some of this garbage, like so.

06:31: Apparently that little blue 
spot is part of the background,

06:34: so I won't worry about it, but I'll probably paint 
along this edge, just to quell it ever so slightly.

06:40: Then we can check out some of the 
other edges, and see how they're faring.

06:43: They are looking pretty good actually.

06:45: That area inside the snout is so big that the 
rounding didn't really cause a problem for it.

06:50: I am going to go ahead and zoom out.

06:51: I am in to far at this point.

06:54: And I think everything 
else is looking pretty good.

06:56: I will just sort of skim 
around here to make sure.

06:59: Now once you get to these holes inside the 
spine, they may seem a little bit too jagged,

07:05: and if so, just make sure your layer mask 
remain selected. Gaussian Blur was the last

07:09: filter you applied,

07:10: so press Control+Alt+F, or Command+Option+F on 
a Mac, to revisit the dialog box, and change

07:16: the Radius value to 0.3 pixels, which is the 
smallest value that actually makes any difference,

07:22: and you will add just a little bit of 
softening around those edges. Then click OK.

07:28: All right. This looks pretty good to me.

07:29: I'll just scroll down to make 
sure everything's in good shape.

07:31: This is a problem.

07:32: This hole needs to be painted out slightly 
here, like so, and you can just hand paint some

07:37: of these details if you want.

07:39: This guy wants a little bit of attention too, but 
you know what? At some point you have to stop,

07:43: so I am going to press the M key in order 
to switch back to the Rectangular Marquee

07:47: tool. Press Control+0 or Command+0 on the Mac, 
to zoom out, and that is the final version

07:52: of my layer mask,

07:53: thanks to my ability to expand holes using 
the minimum filter, as well as correct edge

07:59: fringing using a combination of 
Gaussian Blur along with the Levels command.


 ** Turning a layer into a knockout

00:00: In this movie, we'll put the finishing touches 
on our composition, and I'll show you how to

00:04: turn a layer into a floating knockout 
that cuts holes in the layers below it.

00:09: So the first thing I am going to do is turn 
on the features layer here in order to bring

00:13: in the eyes, and these cartoon hands.

00:16: Now, I want to create the effect of the 
shadow being cast onto the dinosaur,

00:20: so I'll make sure the hadrosaur layer is 
selected, and then I'll drop down to the fx icon, and

00:25: I'll choose neither Drop Shadow, nor Inner 
Shadow, but rather Gradient Overlay, which

00:31: is great for creating shadows that look like they 
were cast not by the layer, but onto the layer.

00:36: All right.

00:37: The first thing I am going to do here, 
assuming default settings, is change the blend mode

00:41: from Normal to Multiply, so that we drop out 
the whites, and we keep the blacks, and we turn

00:46: the entire gradient into one big shadow.

00:49: Then I want the shadow to go at a different 
angle, so we'll go ahead and drag this angle

00:53: line until I get an angle of -146 degrees, meaning 
that the shadow is going down and to the left.

01:00: The shadow is too opaque at this point, so 
I'll reduce the Opacity value to 70% in order

01:05: to achieve the effect you see in the video.

01:08: Now I'll press the Enter key, or the Return 
key in the Mac, in order to accept that change,

01:12: and you can see that really does a great job 
of integrating the dinosaur into the scene.

01:16: So if I click the eyeball in front of Effects, 
this is the untreated version of the dinosaur

01:21: skeleton, and then if I turn the Effects 
back on, this is what it looks like now.

01:26: Finally, I've got this caption group.

01:28: I'll go ahead and turn it on, and you can see 
that it contains some, you know, evil dinosaur

01:33: dialog, but rather than having these hand-drawn 
letters appear white, I want to cut a hole

01:38: through the layer in back of the letters 
to reveal the Earth in the background.

01:42: So I'll go ahead and twirl open the caption 
layer, and I'll click on the text layer to

01:47: make it active, and I'll go ahead and zoom in on that 
text as well, so I can better see what I'm doing.

01:52: And here is how you turn 
any layer into a hole:

01:56: you go ahead and click on an empty portion 
of that layer to bring up the Layer Style

02:00: dialog box, and then you'll see 
this option called Knockout.

02:04: You can set it to either Shallow, or you can 
set it to Deep, but it's not going to make

02:08: any difference at first, because it's entirely 
reliant upon the invisibility of the layer,

02:15: and the easiest way to make the layer 
invisible is to reduce the Fill Opacity.

02:20: So I'll go ahead and take that Fill Opacity 
down to 0%, and you can see that we are now

02:25: using the letters to cut a hole.

02:28: Problem is, we are cutting a very deep hole.

02:30: Well, what does that mean?

02:31: I'll go ahead and show you by 
clicking OK, and scrolling down the list.

02:36: We are cutting a hole all the way down the 
stack to the background image, and if I Alt+click

02:41: or Option+click on the eyeball in front of 
the Background, you can see that it's just

02:44: a synthetic star field set 
against a black background.

02:48: I'll go ahead and Alt+click or Option+click 
again to bring back the other layers, and that's

02:52: why we're seeing mostly black letters 
with a few white dots, which are the stars.

02:57: Now, if I were to double-click on the Background 
in order to convert it to an independent layer,

03:01: and I'll call it stars, for example, and click 
OK, then I'd be cutting through that layer

03:06: as well, all the way down to 
checkerboard transparency.

03:11: So I am revealing nothingness 
essentially, which is not what I want.

03:15: If I just want to cut through this backcard 
layer, then I'd select the text layer again,

03:20: double-click on an empty portion of that 
layer to bring up the Layer Style dialog box, and

03:24: I change the Knockout setting from Deep to 
Shallow, and that goes ahead and reveals the

03:30: yellow, and the blues, by the way, 
of the Earth and the background.

03:34: So the trick is to set the Fill Opacity value to 
0%, and in most cases, set Knockout to Shallow.

03:40: Now, the reason knockout is working for us 
is because we're working inside of a group.

03:45: So your layers have to be part of a 
group in order for this technique to work.

03:49: If I were to select the group, and then press 
Control+Shift+G, or Command+Shift+G on the Mac,

03:54: in order to ungroup those layers, then the 
text, once again, goes ahead and cuts all the

03:58: way through to the background.

04:00: We don't have a background, so it's 
revealing the checkerboard transparency.

04:04: So if you want to contain a Knockout effect 
that's set to Shallow, then you need to select

04:08: the Knockout layer, as well as the layers that 
you want to cut holes in, and then you'd go

04:12: up to the Layers panel flyout menu, and then 
choose New Group from Layers, and I'll call

04:17: this group caption, and then click OK, and we have the 
knockout that we're looking for. All right gang!

04:22: We'll go ahead and press Shift+F in order to 
switch to full screen mode, and then press

04:27: Control+0 to center my zoom, and this is the 
final version of the composition, begun with the

04:33: Color Range command, finessed in the Quick 
Mask mode, and ultimately perfected as a layer

04:38: mask here inside Photoshop.


 ** Refine Edges

00:00: If the best command for creating selections is 
Color Range, the best command for enhancing

00:05: them is Refine Edge. Here's the idea;

00:09: you lay down a base selection 
outline that needs some work,

00:12: and then you choose Refine 
Edge, and make some adjustments.

00:15: You can smooth off the selection, feather 
it, expand or contract it, and so forth.

00:21: And every adjustment previews, so you can 
keep track of what you're doing in real time.

00:27: If that was all you could do, 
Refine Edge would be a decent tool,

00:31: but it's the command's automatic edge 
detection that really sets it apart.

00:36: Dial in a Radius value, and Photoshop traces a 
region that thick on both sides of the selection,

00:42: along the inside, and the outside.

00:45: Then the program applies a kind of artificial 
intelligence within that region, and automatically

00:51: recalculates the edge, 
sometimes with fantastic results.

00:55: If you want to address some edges differently 
than others, then you can brush in the automatic

01:01: recalculation using this thing 
called the Refine Radius tool.

01:05: It really is astounding how well this command 
works, especially on fine details, such as hair,

01:12: even if you start with an incredibly rough 
selection drawn with, say, the Lasso tool.

01:18: But it works better if you combine it with a 
good selection established using Color Range,

01:23: and it also works with layer 
masks as you're about to see.


 ** Laying down a base layer mask

00:00: Over the course of this project, we're going 
to take this guy with this up-swooped hairdo,

00:04: and we're going to mask him against this 
completely different background in order to create this

00:08: final composition, in which, as you can see, 
the hair has survived quite nicely, and I've

00:13: gone ahead and recolored his glasses, and his shirt, 
and his suit to better match this new environment.

00:18: So we'll start off inside this image, and 
in this movie, we're going to go ahead and

00:22: establish a base layer mask using the most 
capable of the automated selection tools,

00:27: which is the Color Range command.

00:29: Notice that the side view layer is 
selected here in the Layers panel.

00:32: That's the photographic image, which comes 
to us from the Fotolia Image Library, about

00:36: which you can learn more, and get 
special deals at fotolia.com/deke.

00:39: I am going to go up to the 
Select menu, and choose Color Range.

00:43: If you loaded dekeKeys, you've got that keyboard shortcut, 
Control+Shift+Alt+G, or Command+Shift+Option+G on the Mac.

00:49: Because black is my foreground color, the 
Color Range command is using black as my key

00:53: color for the selection.

00:55: That's not what I want, so I'll go 
ahead and click in the background here.

00:58: And notice what we're seeing inside of the 
mask preview -- I'll go ahead and change my

01:02: Selection Preview from None to 
Grayscale, so we can see what's going on --

01:06: and notice that even though the photographic 
image is selected there inside the Layers

01:11: panel, and that text layer is not selected 
at all, the Color Range command is seeing

01:15: the composite image, which 
is always what it does.

01:19: So regardless of which layer is selected, 
Color Range sees all layers that are visible.

01:25: So I'm going to cancel out of here, and then 
turn off that text layer, which is actually

01:29: text converted to a shape layer, so 
that we can focus on the image by itself.

01:34: Now go back to the Select menu, and choose 
the Color Range command once again, and you

01:38: notice that when I clicked with the eyedropper, 
I went ahead and changed the foreground color

01:42: to this light beige, so the Color Range command is 
now building the selection around that color.

01:47: I am going to Shift+Drag inside of the 
background in order to select a larger portion of it.

01:53: Now, if I switch Selection Preview back to 
Grayscale, so that I can see a big version

01:56: of the mask, you'll notice that we're 
leaking the selection into the face, which is not

02:00: what I want to do.

02:01: So I'm going to reduce that Fuzziness value 
by clicking inside of it, and then pressing

02:05: Shift+down arrow three times, in fact, 
assuming that we started with the default Fuzziness

02:10: value of 40, in order to 
reduce that Fuzziness value to 10.

02:14: Now, that's going to give us a very sharp 
edge selection, but we'll be able to mitigate

02:18: that harshness using Refine 
Edge in the very next movie.

02:22: So I am going to Shift+Click inside this 
little detail there to select it, and this looks

02:26: like we've selected more or less as much of 
the background as we want to. If we go any

02:29: farther out into the perimeter -- for example, 
if I Shift+Click out here -- we'd run the risk

02:33: of selecting more colors 
inside the model's face.

02:36: So I'll press Control+Z, or Command+Z on 
the Mac, in order to undo that change.

02:40: And once you get a selection that looks more 
or less like the one you see here inside the

02:43: video, then go ahead and turn on the Invert 
checkbox, so that we're selecting the model,

02:48: and not the background, and then click OK in 
order to generate that selection outline.

02:53: Now let's go ahead and apply 
the selection as a layer mask.

02:56: I've already converted the photograph to an 
independent layer, so all I need to do is

02:59: drop down to the Add layer mask icon at the 
bottom of Layers panel, and click on it.

03:04: All right, now let's modify that layer mask; 
make it at least roughly accurate, by Alt+Clicking

03:10: or Option+Clicking on the layer mask thumbnail 
here inside the Layers panel, so that we can

03:14: view the layer mask 
independently of the image.

03:16: And then I'll press Control+0, or Command+0 on 
the Mac, to zoom out so that I can see all

03:21: the way to the edges.

03:22: And as you can see here, I've got the 
Rectangular Marquee tool selected,

03:26: but because the shape of the selection in 
the background is more or less elliptical,

03:30: I am going to press Shift+M to 
switch to the Elliptical Marquee tool,

03:34: and then I think I'll zoom out a click here, 
and I'll go ahead and select, like so, around

03:39: the model, and I am using the spacebar 
to adjust the position of the ellipse.

03:43: Notice that I've completely 
contained the guy inside the ellipse.

03:47: Now I'll go up to the Select menu, and choose 
the Inverse command, or press Control+Shift+I,

03:50: Command+Shift+I on the Mac, to 
select the area outside that ellipse.

03:54: And in my case, the background color is black; 
if it isn't that way for you, just go ahead

03:58: and tap the D key, and then press Control+Backspace 
or Command+Delete to fill that area with black.

04:04: All right, now I'll press Control+D, or Command+D 
on the Mac to deselect the image, and I'll

04:09: go ahead and zoom in as well.

04:10: I need to do some additional clean up, so 
I'll switch to the Brush tool, which you can

04:14: get by pressing the B key.

04:16: Right-click inside the image, and just make sure 
your Hardness value is cranked up to 100%.

04:19: All right, now I'll press the Enter key, or 
the Return key on the Mac to dismiss that

04:23: panel, and I'll increase the size of my cursor 
a little bit by pressing the right bracket

04:27: key, and oops! Painting with the wrong color 
here, so I'll press Control+Z, or Command+Z on

04:32: the Mac, and press the X key to 
make the foreground color black,

04:35: and then I'll go ahead and paint in some of this 
garbage that still remains here in the background.

04:40: I may have some over here as well, so I'll just go 
ahead and paint around to make sure it's gone.

04:46: And if you want to test your background, what 
you can do is you can switch from the Quick

04:49: Selection tool to the Magic Wand tool.

04:52: Then press the Enter key in order to highlight 
the Tolerance value, change it to 0, and turn

04:57: off Anti-alias, and then go ahead and click in the 
background to see the good stuff versus the bad stuff.

05:02: So in my case, I can see that I've got all 
of the black pixels selected, and I have a

05:06: smattering of very dark gray 
pixels in front of the guy's face.

05:10: So you know what? I'll just press Control+D, 
Command+D on the Mac, to deselect the image,

05:14: and I'll press Control+L, or Command+L on the 
Mac, to bring up the Levels dialog box.

05:18: And I am going to crank this 
black point value pretty high.

05:21: Let's say I take it up to 110, for example, 
in order to hopefully wipe all that stuff

05:27: out, and then I'll click OK.

05:29: And now I'll try clicking again, and sure 
enough, that took care of that problem.

05:33: That gives us an even more jagged selection 
outline. Again, that's totally okay, because

05:38: Refine Edge will take care of that problem.

05:40: I'll press Control+D, or Command+D on the Mac, 
to deselect the image, and I'm going to go

05:44: ahead and zoom in a little bit. Press the B 
key to switch back to the Brush tool, press

05:48: the left bracket key to reduce the size of the 
brush, and paint away some of this area here.

05:53: Press the X key to switch the foreground color to 
white and paint away that garbage inside of his face.

05:59: Now, this is still pretty 
rough, as you can see here.

06:02: I've got all kinds of stray 
pixels all over the place.

06:05: Press the X key in order to switch the foreground 
color to black, and paint this little area away.

06:10: But I'm thinking for now that this is more or 
less going to take care of it for me, although

06:13: I am going to increase the size of my brush, 
press the X key, and paint this stuff away

06:18: along the rear side of the model's body.

06:20: Again, take care not to paint right against 
an edge, or you can mess up the selection.

06:25: All right, that looks pretty good to me.

06:27: This will serve as a base layer mask.

06:30: I'll Alt+Click or Option+Click on that layer 
mask thumbnail again in order to see the masked

06:34: version of the photograph.

06:36: And now that we've set up a base layer mask -- 
and it could just as easily, by the way, be

06:40: a base selection outline --

06:42: We're ready to perfect that mask using the 
Refine Edge command, which I'll introduce

06:47: you to in the very next movie.


 ** Introducing the Refine Edge/Mask command

00:00: In this movie, I'll introduce you to what 
I generally call the Refine Edge command.

00:04: And the reason I say that is because 
it technically goes by two names.

00:09: If you have a layer mask 
selected, it's called Refine Mask.

00:12: If you have a selection outline 
active, then it's called Refine Edge.

00:16: Either way, it does the exact same thing.

00:18: I am going to start things off by 
giving this guy a new background.

00:21: So I will switch over to this flat JPEG image. I 
will convert the background to an independently

00:25: layer by double-clicking on it here inside 
the Layers panel, and I will just call it

00:29: sky, and click OK.

00:31: Now, armed with my Rectangular Marquee tool, 
I will right-click inside the image window,

00:34: and choose Duplicate Layer, and then I will 
switch the document to Rough base mask.psd,

00:40: which is my composition in progress, 
and then I will click OK. All right.

00:44: Now if I switch back to that composition, I can see 
the sky is in front, and the portrait shot is in back.

00:49: So I will drag the sky to the bottom of the 
stack, and then I will click on the side view

00:53: layer to make it active.

00:54: Now I am going to go ahead and zoom in here; 
notice that we have not only some very rough

00:59: edges, of course, but some very clumsy edges over 
here on the left-hand side of the guy's face.

01:05: The easiest way to take care of those problems 
is to use the Magic Wand tool; it's just going

01:10: to serve us best.

01:11: So you can go ahead and select the Magic Wand 
from the Quick Selection tool flyout menu,

01:15: and then press the Enter key in order to 
highlight the Tolerance value, and I am going to take

01:19: it up to 16 luminance levels.

01:21: And you can go ahead and turn on the Anti-alias 
checkbox as well, for all the good it does us.

01:26: Then go ahead and click right here above the 
guy's shoulder in order to select a great

01:30: deal of the background, as you can see.

01:32: I will go ahead and zoom out to take in the 
marching ants, which are tracing the entirety

01:36: of the front of the guy's face, as well as 
up along the top of the hair, and out a ways

01:41: into that gradually lit 
background. All right.

01:43: I am going to go ahead and zoom back in, so I 
can see those edges up close and personal,

01:48: and I will click on the layer mask thumbnail 
here inside the Layers panel to make sure

01:51: the layer mask is active.

01:52: Black is my foreground color, so I will press 
Control+Backspace, or Command+Delete on the Mac,

01:57: to fill that selection with black. All right.

01:59: Now that we have something that the Refine 
Edge command can work with, I will go ahead

02:02: and double-click on the layer mask thumbnail 
in order to bring up the Properties panel.

02:06: Now, normally the Mask Edge 
button would not be dimmed;

02:09: it would be available to us, and I could go 
ahead and click on it in order to bring up

02:13: the Refine Mask dialog box.

02:14: In my case, however, I can't, 
because there's a selection active.

02:18: Let me go ahead and hide the Properties panel.

02:20: I will show you another way to get to the 
command, which is to go up to the Select menu,

02:23: and choose Refine Edge in this case, or you 
can press a keyboard shortcut, Control+Alt+R,

02:29: or Command+Option+R on the Mac.

02:31: Now, the fact that the command is called 
Refine Edge instead of Refine Mask tells us that

02:36: Photoshop is going to apply the effects of the 
command to the selection outline, as opposed

02:41: to the layer mask.

02:43: That's not what we want.

02:43: So I will press the Escape key in order to 
hide that menu, and I will press Control+D, or

02:48: Command+D on the Mac, in 
order to deselect the image.

02:51: Now if I go ahead and double-click on the 
layer mask thumbnail, the Mask Edge button

02:54: is available, and I can click on it to 
bring up the Refine Mask dialog box.

02:59: Problem is, then if I try to scoot the dialog 
box out of the way, the Properties panel is

03:03: blocking part of the image in the background.

03:05: That's not what I want, so I will cancel out, 
and hide Properties, and instead of using

03:09: that button, I'll go up to the Select menu, 
and choose what is now Refine Mask, thereby

03:15: telling me that I will affect the 
layer mask, because there is no selection.

03:20: So if there is a selection, it gets priority.

03:22: If there's no selection, you can 
choose the Refine Mask command.

03:25: And that's what I will go ahead and do in 
order to bring up the Refine Mask dialog box.

03:30: Now, I want you to see here that you've got 
this View option, and it represents a tiny

03:34: preview of our composition.

03:36: In our case, we're seeing the mask 
guy against a white background.

03:39: If that's not what you want, you can click 
on that icon there, and you can switch to,

03:43: for example, On Black to see him against the 
black background, or Black & White in order

03:49: to see the layer mask itself.

03:51: If you choose On Layers, you'll see the guy 
against the cloud background, and if you click

03:56: on Reveal Layer, you'll see 
the active layer by itself.

03:59: In my case, I think On Black is going to 
represent things the best. All right.

04:02: Now I will click away 
from the menu to hide it.

04:05: For now, we're going to focus our attention on 
the Adjust Edge options here; Smooth, Feather,

04:10: Contrast, and Shift Edge.

04:11: They are in large part modeled after the 
commands that are available under the Select menu.

04:15: You go down to Modify, and then normally, 
if I were working on a selection outline,

04:19: I could gain access to commands 
like Smooth, and Feather, and so forth.

04:24: These options right here serve the same purpose, 
except for one big difference: you can preview

04:28: your modifications as you apply them, which 
is not true when using the select commands.

04:34: So in other words, these 
options right here are better.

04:37: For example, let's start with 
something familiar, like Feather.

04:40: I will go ahead and click inside of it, and 
I will increase that Feather value to, say,

04:43: 20, and that goes ahead and blurs the mask, 
and we can see the degree to which it blurs

04:47: the mask on the fly.

04:49: And this would be true if we were working 
with a selection outline as well; we would

04:53: get this exact same preview if we had the 
view set to On Black, and we could see the

04:58: effects of feathering the 
selection as we do here.

05:01: The Contrast value allows you to increase 
the sharpness of that edge, so now that I've

05:05: gotten done blurring it, if I take the Contrast 
value up to 80%, for example, I end up with

05:10: this much sharper version of the edge.

05:13: Notice how that rounds the heck out of the 
corners, however, including things that aren't

05:17: really corners; just divots along the edge.

05:20: So a combination of a high Feather and Contrast 
value ends up approximating that selection edge.

05:26: If you want to shift the edge inward or 
outward, you use the Shift Edge option.

05:31: And if you apply a positive value by dragging 
the slider triangle over to the right, then

05:35: you move the edge outward.

05:37: If you drag the triangle over to the left in 
order to apply a negative value, then you

05:41: move the edge inward.

05:43: I don't want to do any of that.

05:44: I am going to zero out all those 
values there by Shift+Tabbing my way back.

05:48: I'm interested in adjusting the Smooth setting, 
because after all, we have very ratty, jagged edges.

05:53: I will go ahead and zoom in a little 
farther even, so we can see him here.

05:57: And that's not his razor 
stubble, even though he has got some.

06:00: That is just some bad edge detail.

06:02: So notice, if I start taking this Smooth 
value up by pressing Shift+up arrow, then I will

06:07: smooth that edge dramatically. However, if I 
take it too far, then I end up, once again,

06:13: rounding off the corners.

06:14: That's not what I want.

06:14: So I am going to take the Smooth value back 
down to 0, and then I'll press the up arrow

06:19: key in order to nudge that value upward until 
I get a very smooth edge, as you can see here,

06:25: which happens for me as low as 5.

06:29: Then I'll tab my way down to Shift Edge, and 
I will press Shift+down arrow in order to

06:34: shift that edge inward, like so. And I'm ultimately 
going to take it, let's say, to something like

06:39: -50 might work out pretty well.

06:42: Now, if you want to compare the before and 
after, you turn on Show Original to turn the

06:46: preview off, and then you turn show 
original back on to turn the preview setting on.

06:52: And you know, I think this is the wrong combination of 
values, so I am going to try a higher Smooth value here.

06:57: So I will set that guy to 10, and then 
I will take Shift Edge down to -20.

07:02: I think that ends up being a better combination,
because what you're doing with Shift Edge

07:06: is you're shifting the edge 
inside of the gray space.

07:09: So in other words, wherever you have gray 
pixels in the mask, that's the area in which

07:14: you can shift that edge back and forth.

07:16: So you can't shift white into black;

07:18: you can just make the gray pixels brighter, or in our 
case, darker, because we're shifting the edge inward.

07:25: And when I say gray pixels, I mean the gray pixels 
in the mask, not the gray pixels in the image.

07:29: All right.

07:30: That looks pretty good to me,

07:31: so I'm going to go ahead and click OK in order 
to accept that modification, and just to give

07:35: you a sense of what were able to accomplish here, 
I will press Control+Z, or Command+Z on the Mac.

07:40: There's our very jagged 
selection outline at 400%.

07:44: And if I press Control+Z or Command+Z again, 
we can see that it is much smoother now,

07:49: thanks to some very basic modifications 
applied using the Refine Mask command here inside

07:54: Photoshop.


 ** Edge detection and Smart Radius

00:00: In this movie, we'll take a look at the Refine 
Edge command's automatic edge detection functions,

00:05: which are what really truly separate it 
from anything else inside Photoshop.

00:10: So I have got this guy here, and his 
sharp edges are looking a little better,

00:14: that is, the edges along his face, and along 
the top of his shoulder, but his hair looks

00:19: terrible, as you can see here.

00:21: We have got obvious color fringing going on 
along the back of his head, and then his hair,

00:26: which obviously contains a ton of mousse, 
looks less human than porcupine at this point.

00:32: So I really want to refine that selection, 
so that we are masking individual strands

00:36: of hair instead of big 
clumps of hair, as we are now.

00:40: So with the layer mask thumbnail selected 
here inside the Layers panel, I'll go up to

00:44: the Select menu, and once again choose Refine 
Mask in order to bring up the Refine Mask

00:49: dialog box. And incidentally, in my experience, 
you can apply the Refine Edge or Refine Mask

00:54: command as many times as you like in a row 
without really making any destructive modifications,

00:59: and that's because, even though applying any 
command in a static capacity, which is what

01:04: we're doing here, is technically destructive,

01:06: we are not modifying the photographic image.

01:08: We are modifying the layer mask, and 
therefore we have a lot more leeway.

01:12: Now, I want you to notice this 
Edge Detection feature right here.

01:15: We can see that we have got a Radius 
value, and it's measured in pixels.

01:18: The Feather setting is also a radius value, and it's 
measured in pixels, but there's a big difference.

01:23: Folks tend to mix these two up, and they serve 
totally different purposes. Let me show you.

01:27: If I take the Feather value up to 20, for example,
then we end up creating a blurry mask, which

01:34: doesn't do us any good. And I can 
especially see how little good it does me

01:38: if I switch my view from On Black to On layers, 
so that I can see the sky in the background.

01:43: That is not a realistic mask at all.

01:45: What it is is it's a fudge.

01:47: We are just throwing up our hands in despair, 
and saying, well you know, better to have a

01:51: blurry mask than that 
ugly thing we had before.

01:53: Well, it turns out we can 
do much better than either.

01:56: So I'll go ahead and reduce the Feather 
value to 0, so we get back to that porcupine

01:59: hair, and now I'll change the Radius value 
up toward the top of the dialog box to 20

02:05: pixels, and press the Tab key, and 
notice what a different result we get.

02:09: And just that one change makes a 
terrific difference to the image.

02:14: What's happening here is we're creating an 
alleyway around the edges of the image in

02:19: which Photoshop can work its magic, and 
let me show you what I mean by that.

02:22: I am going to turn on 
the Show Radius checkbox.

02:25: Notice, all the areas that we can see -- that is,

02:27: they're not covered in black -- those are the 
areas that fall inside of this 20 pixel radius,

02:33: and that is the region in which the Refine Edge 
command will redefine the edges of the mask.

02:39: So that's what's meant by 
Edge Detection right here.

02:42: The Refine Mask command is saying, tell me the area in 
which I can run my edge detection, and I'll do it.

02:48: And with the 20 pixel radius, 
things work out pretty darn well.

02:51: Problem is -- I'll go ahead and click in one 
of the numerical values, so I can zoom in by

02:55: Control+Spacebar+Clicking;

02:55: that would be Command+Spacebar+Clicking 
on the Mac.

02:59: Notice this guy's forehead right there.

03:01: So there is the hair at 
the top of the forehead.

03:02: There is this shiny pale forehead, with a little 
bit of blue poking through, and that's because

03:07: of edge detection.

03:09: Basically, this is a bad result of edge detection, 
because after all, like any automated function,

03:14: sometimes edge detection does great stuff, 
and sometimes it makes a mess of things.

03:18: Well, you can address that problem by 
turning on the Smart Radius checkbox.

03:21: Let me zoom out here a couple of clicks, so 
you can see what happens to this alleyway,

03:26: which right now is uniformly 20 pixels thick.

03:29: Now, sometimes it looks to be thicker, but 
that's because the original edge of the mask

03:33: was little wonky inside of 
some of these hair areas.

03:37: If I turn on the Smart Radius checkbox, we 
are going to reduce the radius around the

03:42: guy's face, while keeping the radius 
nice and big inside of his hair.

03:46: So Photoshop is automatically addressing 
which areas need tighter control, and which areas

03:51: need loose control.

03:53: That is to say, the face needs tight control, 
and the hair needs the loose stuff; needs

03:57: a lot of edge detection.

03:59: And so now if I turn off the Show Radius checkbox,
you can see that that little shine there on

04:04: the guy's forehead has 
disappeared to an extent.

04:07: It's still there a little bit, but it looks a 
lot better than it did before. All right,

04:11: but tell you what; it's not quite everything I 
would like. We still have some color fringing

04:16: along the back of the guy's head.

04:18: We have an awful lot of the original background 
appearing inside of his hair, and then we have

04:23: some kind of messed up edges down here.

04:25: If you zoom in on the guy's chin, you 
can see we have some holes in the chin.

04:29: We have some holes in the sport coat.

04:31: We have a hole in his shoulder as well.

04:33: Fortunately, we can take care of all of those 
problems by brushing in our own custom edge

04:38: enhancements, just as 
we'll do in the next movie.


 ** Using the Refine Radius tool

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to use the 
Refine Radius tool which is a tool that's

00:04: available to you exclusively when you're working 
inside the Refine Edge or Refine Mask dialog box.

00:10: So here I am looking at that same 
image from the previous movie.

00:13: I've applied a Radius of 20 pixels, and 
turned on the Smart Radius checkbox.

00:17: Now what we need to do is go ahead and scroll 
our way up to the hair; maybe zoom out a

00:22: click, because that's a little too close.

00:23: Now, notice that as I'm moving my cursor inside 
the image window it's a brush, and that brush

00:29: represents this tool right there; the Refine 
Radius tool, which allows you to brush more

00:33: radius into your image, that is, you're 
brushing in a larger area of edge detection.

00:38: Now, you can change the size of your 
brush up here in the options bar.

00:42: Notice, in my case, it's set to 25, or you 
can press one of the square bracket keys.

00:47: Now, in a Mac, you're going to have no problems.

00:49: On Windows, it's a little tricky, because the 
values get stuck, and so Photoshop isn't paying

00:54: attention to you.

00:55: What you need to do if you want to take 
advantage of the bracket key trick, is you need

00:58: to turn on the Show Original checkbox, and 
then turn it back off, so that the option

01:03: is kind of sticky there and then you can 
press the right bracket key to increase the size

01:08: of the brush, or the left bracket 
key to reduce the size of the brush.

01:11: I'm going to increase the size of my brush 
to, say, 100 pixels, let's say, and then I'm

01:16: going to start by brushing into that background; in 
between the hairs, that bit of beige background,

01:21: then I am going to brush back and forth.
And notice what a difference it makes.

01:24: It goes ahead and gets rid of that background, 
and replaces it with blue right away, and

01:29: the reason is, I just brushed in more radius.

01:30: If I turn on the Show Radius checkbox, 
you can see I brushed in this region.

01:34: Now, formerly -- if I press Control+Z, or Command+Z 
on the Mac -- that formerly looked like this.

01:40: All right, so I'll press Control+Z, or Command+Z 
on the Mac, again to redo that modification,

01:45: because you have one level of undo 
when working inside this dialog box.

01:50: Now I will turn Show Radius back off, and I 
will brush along this main row of porcupine

01:54: quills in order to bring the 
individual strands of hair into the sky.

01:58: And then I'll go ahead and brush into the 
back of this guy's head as well in order to

02:02: get rid of the background that was showing 
through there, and I might as well brush into

02:06: this sort of cowlick or whatever it is in 
order to get rid of any remaining remnants

02:12: of that previous beige background.

02:13: All right, now I am going to zoom in on the 
head, and notice this area, right there;

02:17: this little bit of highlight 
that's showing through.

02:19: I don't want that.

02:21: So I'm going to reduce the size my brush by 
pressing the left bracket key several times.

02:25: Now you can go ahead and click and hold on 
the Refine Radius tool, and switch to the Erase

02:30: Refinements tool, but 
you don't really need to.

02:32: You can get to it on the fly.

02:34: So I am just going to leave the Refine Radius 
tool selected, and I will press the Alt key,

02:37: or the Option key on the Mac, and notice what 
was formerly a plus sign inside of my cursor

02:41: becomes a minus sign, showing me 
that I can brush away Radius.

02:45: So I want to say, all right, you know what Photoshop?
Your edge detection isn't working so well here.

02:49: So I'll go ahead and brush away at that forehead 
and we get back the original masked edge, which

02:54: looks a lot better.

02:55: All right, here I think we could 
use some more edge detection.

02:58: So I will just go ahead and brush some stuff in, 
as opposed to Alt+Dragging or Option+Dragging,

03:03: and then I might sort of zoom in at this location,
reduce the size of my cursor some more, and

03:07: press the Alt key, or the Option key on the 
Mac, to brush away some of the front of the

03:12: sunglasses there.

03:13: Let's see what else we've got.

03:14: We might have some problems in the guy's nose.

03:17: So we'll Alt+Drag or Option+Drag inside the 
tip of the nose there in order to restore

03:22: the original appearance of that nose.

03:24: We know we've got some problems in the chin,

03:27: so I will Alt+Drag or Option+Drag like that, and that 
goes and reinstates the better version of the chin.

03:33: It might not be exactly what we are looking 
for, but we will have to fix that later.

03:36: And then I will go ahead and brush up along 
the mouth, and lips as well, in order to bring

03:41: back those original edges.

03:43: Here is a problem.

03:44: Now, I don't want to just go ahead and Alt+
Drag or Option+Drag like that, because I'll get

03:49: some of the old garbage that was no good.

03:51: So I'll go ahead and press Control+Z, or Command+Z on 
a Mac, in order to reinstate the edge detection.

03:56: And by the way, what you are brushing back to 
is what you had before you chose the command

04:01: in the first place.

04:02: So if you ever want to test what's going on 
in a region, then you turn on Show Original,

04:06: and you decide, well, is 
it better, or is it worse?

04:08: If it's better, then I need to brush it away.

04:10: If it's worse, I need to leave it intact.

04:12: In my case, it's worse right at this corner 
location; however, it's better along the red collar.

04:18: So I'll turn Show Original back on, so I can 
see what I'm doing, and I'll Alt+Drag just

04:23: right along here, like so, and that goes ahead 
and gives us back the good stuff that we had

04:28: before, while keeping the 
new good stuff as well.

04:32: I might just go ahead and reduce the size 
of my cursor a little bit, and click right

04:36: there in order to make sure 
that I have that corner.

04:39: I'll go ahead and brush along here too, and that 
helps that whisker area tremendously actually.

04:44: All right, now I want to scroll, and here on 
Windows,if I want to Spacebar+drag inside the

04:48: image window, I have to click inside 
a numerical value to make it active.

04:52: What a pain in the neck!

04:53: Again, you lucky Macintosh people don't have 
to worry about it. And I'll scroll my way

04:57: over to the shoulder here, and 
notice that it's a bit of a problem,

05:00: so I will Alt+Drag or Option+Drag along the 
shoulder in order to reinstate it, so we are

05:05: not seeing any of that bad blue.

05:07: All right, let's go ahead and zoom out by pressing 
Control+Minus, or Command+Minus on the Mac, and see what we've got.

05:12: And things are actually 
looking pretty darn good I think.

05:15: I might just try pressing the right bracket 
key a few times in order to increase the size

05:19: of my brush, and painting right back there 
in order to see if I can get some more blue

05:24: into that hair region, and I think this is it.

05:27: Now, there's one last option I will show you, but I 
am going to tell you that I don't care for it.

05:33: And it's this one down here:
Decontaminate Colors.

05:35: It's located in the Output options.

05:37: Notice, Output To is set to Layer Mask.

05:39: That means when you click OK, 
you're going to modify the layer mask.

05:42: If you turn on Decontaminate Colors, which 
is going to try to modify the actual colors

05:46: inside the image in order to better match 
the new background, then you're going to see

05:51: a slight shift in the colors in the hair.

05:53: They're going to get a little more purplish, 
and then you can increase that Amount value

05:57: to make them even still more 
purplish, or what have you.

06:00: In my case, it looks like it's filling out 
the hairs, which seems like a great thing.

06:04: The problem is, we are going to output this 
image to a new layer with a layer mask.

06:08: The layer mask is going be the same layer 
mask, but we are going to be modifying the

06:11: colors inside the layer,

06:13: and we are not going to be 
modifying the colors uniformly.

06:15: That's a problem.

06:16: The color shifts only happen right around 
the edge of the mask, which means if you need

06:20: to go back and make manual modifications to 
the layer mask, which we do, then the new

06:25: colors won't look right at all.

06:27: So if you've been following along with me, 
what I am going to ask you to do is turn off

06:29: Decontaminate Colors, and then switch Output 
To back to Layer Mask, because we want to

06:34: make permanent 
modifications to that layer mask.

06:36: All right, I am going to Alt+Drag in that 
little area of hair there in order to reinstate

06:40: the opaque hair, and I might do the same 
right here and see what I come up with, because

06:44: we are going a little too 
far with those modifications.

06:47: Let's see; if I Alt+Drag 
or Option+Drag up there,

06:50: now we've gone too far with getting rid of the 
edge detection, so I'll go ahead and drag, like so.

06:55: This time I am dragging; not Alt+Dragging 
or Option+Dragging, and I end up with this

06:59: result, which I think is about as good as I am 
going to do where this command is concerned.

07:04: So we'll go ahead and press Control+0, or Command+
0 on the Mac, to center my zoom, and then I'll

07:09: click OK in order to accept my modifications.

07:13: And that's how you take advantage of the 
powerful world of automatic edge detection, using a

07:18: combination of the Radius value, the Smart 
Radius checkbox, and the custom Refine Radius

07:23: tool available to you only when you're working 
inside the Refine Edge or Refine Mask dialog

07:28: box.


 ** The transformative power of Refine Edge

00:00: In this movie, I'll give you a sense for the 
amazing power of automatic edge detection

00:04: inside Photoshop.

00:06: So what we'll do is we'll start with just 
the worst selection outline ever, and we'll

00:09: turn it into something really pretty darn 
great lickety-split using Refine Mask.

00:15: But first, I was a little bit remiss in the 
previous movie; I didn't show you a before and

00:19: after what we had accomplished.

00:20: So this is the before 
version of our selection.

00:24: I'll go ahead and zoom in on that hair, and 
you can see just how thick and gooey the hair

00:27: looks, and how we have all this color 
fringing from the old background.

00:31: Then here is what we're able to accomplish 
using the automatic edge detection included

00:36: along with Refine Mask.

00:38: But it gets even better than that.

00:40: I'm going to switch over to this image here, 
which features an unmasked version of the

00:44: portrait shot with the sky in the background.

00:47: I'll go ahead and turn that side view layer 
on and make it active, and now I'm going to

00:50: press Control+0, or Command+0 on the Mac, just to 
zoom out,so I can take in the entire image

00:54: with a little bit of the dark gray pasteboard.

00:56: I'll press the L key to switch to the Lasso 
tool, and I'm going to draw a polygonal selection

01:01: outline around this guy.

01:02: So I will press and hold the Alt key, or the 
Option key on the Mac, and I'll start by clicking

01:07: down here, and then I'll click my way up, as 
you can see me doing now, and I'm going to

01:11: do a pretty rough job.

01:12: I might try as sort of select into the lips 
and the nose a little bit, but I'm not to

01:17: make an effort to be that accurate.

01:19: Then I'll click my way up and around the hair, 
like so, and I've got the Alt or Option key

01:23: down this entire time, so I'm 
drawing a polygonal selection outline.

01:27: Then I'll click my way down, past the right 
shoulder, into the pasteboard once again, and

01:31: I will release the Alt key, or the Option key in 
the Mac, in order to complete that selection.

01:36: Now let's convert it to a layer mask by 
clicking on the Add layer mask icon at the bottom of

01:40: Layers panel, and we end up with 
this just horribly masked image.

01:45: I'll go ahead and zoom in, so that we can 
inspect its horribleness that much more closely.

01:49: Now I'll go ahead and press the keyboard shortcut 
Control+Alt+R, or Command+Option+R on the Mac,

01:54: to bring up the Refine Mask command, and I'm 
going to increase the Radius value to 20 pixels.

01:59: And just that one change makes a terrific 
difference to the appearance of the mask.

02:05: Now I need to go ahead and paint into 
the hair using my Refine Radius tool.

02:09: So I'll just go ahead and paint in, like so, 
into this area right there, and then paint

02:14: along the top of the hair, and over to the 
side, and release, and Photoshop does this.

02:20: So you don't necessarily have to start 
with a great selection in the first place.

02:23: Now I'll go and paint down along the back of the 
guy's head in order to clear up those details as well.

02:29: Now, the hair looks pretty much just as 
good as it does with the other composition.

02:32: However, what suffers is the smooth details.

02:35: So you can see that we've got the hole in 
forehead, and if I were to reduce the size

02:39: of my cursor and Alt+Drag or Option+Drag along 
the forehead, I could make that a little better.

02:44: Then I would have to spend time working on 
the nose, and the lips, and the chin as well,

02:48: and so forth in order firm up those details.

02:51: However, of course, thanks to the fact that we 
selected the image in the first place using

02:55: Color Range, we didn't have to apply quite 
this many modifications, and we are getting

03:00: better results in the first place.

03:01: For example, there's really no way to recover this chin 
properly, because the previous selection was just bad.

03:07: So I'd have to paint over that chin, and 
hope for the best, and I've got a bunch of blue

03:11: showing through this stubble here, 
which I'd have to correct later.

03:14: Anyway, I will go ahead and click the OK button 
in order to accept my modifications, and I'll

03:19: zoom out, so that we can take in 
more of the image at a time.

03:22: If I press Control+Z, or Command+Z on a Mac, this 
is what my polygonal selection outline looked

03:26: like, and then if I press Control+Z or Command+Z 
again, we can bear witness to the raw power

03:32: of one of the best selection 
automation tools in all of Photoshop.


 ** Perfecting a mask with overlay painting

00:00: All right! So, starting out from where we left off a couple of 
movies ago, our layer mask is in pretty darn good shape.

00:06: However, it still needs some help, 
especially along the front of this guy's face.

00:11: So we're going to be manually enhancing the 
mask using a special overlay painting trick

00:15: that's really great for retouching masks in 
general, and I'll also pass along a few keyboard

00:20: tricks for switching between the full 
color composition and the layer mask.

00:25: Now, in my case, the layer mask is 
active here inside the Layers panel.

00:27: I want to view it by itself, and you can do 
that by Alt+Clicking or Option+Clicking on

00:32: the layer mask thumbnail.

00:33: Then if you zoom in on this guy's nose, and 
lips, and chin, you can see that we've got

00:38: a lot of gray pixels, and some 
rough edges remain as well.

00:41: So I am going to firm those up by switching 
over to the Brush tool, which you can get by

00:45: pressing the B key, and then I will right-click 
inside my image, and as opposed to painting

00:49: with a Hardness of 100%, I'll crank that 
Hardness value down to 0%, and then I will

00:54: press the Enter key, or 
the Return key on the Mac.

00:56: Now let's say I want to make 
those dark edges nice and jet black.

00:59: I'll press the X key so that my foreground 
color is black, and then if I start painting,

01:04: you will see that I paint in a 
fuzzy brushstroke, which is no good.

01:07: I don't want that.

01:07: So I will press Control+Z, 
or Command+Z on a Mac.

01:10: What I want to do is limit my brushstroke 
to just the darkest details, and I can do

01:16: that by changing the blend 
mode assigned to the stroke.

01:20: The best blend mode for this 
kind of thing is Overlay.

01:23: So I will go ahead and choose Overlay, and 
notice now, if I apply that same brushstroke --

01:28: I'm just brushing in along that edge,
along the dark side of the edge --

01:32: notice that I'm darkening up the darkest 
pixels, and I'm leaving the white area alone.

01:37: If I paint inside of white with black, I do 
nothing when working in the Overlay mode.

01:43: Then if I want to bolster the bright details 
on the other side, I'd press the X key to

01:47: make my foreground color white, and I paint 
along the front of the nose, for example, in

01:52: order to achieve this effect here. And I will 
paint down into the lip as well, and maybe

01:56: into the chin too, maybe down here 
just a little bit; just give it a click.

02:01: Now I will press the X key in order to switch 
back to black, and I will paint along the front

02:05: of the glasses, and up into the forehead.

02:08: Then I will press the X key to switch back 
to white, and I will paint down on the other

02:11: side of the forehead.

02:12: That gets us to about 50% of the way there.

02:15: Now I want to show you some 
tricks for working with layer masks.

02:18: If you switch over to the Channels panel, 
you'll see that the layer mask turns up as

02:22: a temporary alpha channel, and we can see 
that it's selected, and only that alpha channel

02:27: is visible; the RGB image is hidden.

02:30: We've got some keyboard shortcuts.

02:31: So you've got Control+backslash or 
Command+backslash to switch to the layer mask.

02:36: If I press Command+2 or Control+2, then I 
switch back to the full color composite.

02:41: Notice that switches things 
in the Layers panel as well.

02:43: So now the layer mask thumbnail is active,
because I pressed Command+2 or Control+2.

02:47: If I press Command+backslash or Control+backslash, 
then I switch over to layer mask, so I'm editing it.

02:53: You can also control the visibility of the 
mask by pressing the backslash key on its own.

02:58: And notice now that I'm seeing the layer mask 
as a rubylith overlay, just as I do when working

03:03: in the Quick Mask mode.

03:05: If I want to change the color of that overlay,
I'd switch over to the Channels panel, and

03:09: double-click on that layer mask thumbnail 
there, and then I could click on the color

03:14: swatch, and dial in something more complementary, 
such as a Hue value of 180 degrees, click

03:19: OK, then click OK again, and that 
changes the color of that overlay.

03:24: If I now want to hide the image, and view the 
mask by itself, I press the Tilde key; that

03:29: same keyboard trick that 
works in the Quick Mask mode.

03:32: Then to switch back to the composite image, 
I'd press the Tilde key again to see both

03:36: the image and the mask at the same time, and 
then I'd press the backslash key, so that I'm

03:41: no longer seeing the mask, and you can see 
that that controls the visibility of the

03:45: various channels here 
inside the Channels panel.

03:48: So the layer mask is still active, but 
we're seeing the RGB image by itself.

03:54: What that allows me to do is clean up 
some of these bad details right there.

03:58: So I am going to increase the Hardness of 
my brush to 100% by right-clicking inside

04:02: the image window and 
cranking up that Hardness value.

04:04: Then I will press the Enter key, or the Return 
key on a Mac, to hide the panel, and I'll switch

04:08: the blend mode up here back to Normal by pressing 
Shift+Alt+N, or Shift+Option+N on the Mac. And

04:14: then, with white as my foreground color, I'll 
just go ahead and paint like this, because

04:18: this is a very ratty edge indeed that I want 
to paint away, and then I will press the X

04:22: key to make black my foreground color, and 
I'll just go ahead and click inside this region

04:28: here a few times in order to 
reinstate a better edge for that nose.

04:34: I might also press the L key to switch to 
Lasso tool, press and hold the Alt key, or

04:38: the Option key on a Mac, and then dig my way 
into that corner inside the lips, and press

04:43: Alt+Backspace or Option+Delete to fill it 
with black. And I might need to do something

04:48: similar down here.

04:49: I will press Control+D, or Command+D on a Mac, to 
deselect the image, then Alt+Click around

04:53: this region to select it, press Alt+Backspace 
or Option+Delete, and then press Control+D, or

04:58: Command+D on a Mac, to go ahead 
and add in a nice sharp corner.

05:03: We've got a little weirdness 
going right there in that chin,

05:06: so I am going to press the backslash key to 
view the layer mask, and press the Tilde key

05:10: to hide the image, so I can 
see the mask by itself.

05:12: I will press the B key to switch back to my 
Brush tool, press the X key to switch the

05:17: foreground color to white, and then click in 
that chin in order to get rid of that bad

05:21: edge right there.

05:22: We need to do some work 
on these glasses as well.

05:24: That's what I am looking at in this region.

05:27: And I might go ahead and press the X key to 
switch my foreground color to black, and paint

05:31: into the glasses, like so.

05:33: I am just going to paint up and over them.

05:35: And now let's go ahead and switch back to 
the full color image by pressing the Tilde

05:39: key to view the image, and then pressing the backslash 
key so that I can see the full color image by itself.

05:45: Actually, if I press the backslash key again, 
pressing it to turn the layer mask on and off,

05:50: it looks like I'm doing a pretty good job, 
actually, of selecting the image at this point.

05:55: That's because, if I switch back to Layers 
panel, I'd have to Shift+Click on the layer mask

05:59: to see what the image looks like unmasked.

06:01: So Shift+Clicking on that layer 
mask thumbnail turns it off.

06:04: I know these are a bunch of keyboard shortcuts, but 
they're really darn useful if you can remember them.

06:09: I am going to press the L key in order to 
switch to the Lasso tool, and then press and

06:13: hold the Alt key, or the Option key on a Mac, 
and click around this area of the sunglasses

06:18: like so in order to select them.

06:20: Then I'll go ahead and smooth that selection.

06:21: I could do that using the Refine Edge command,
but I am just going to go up to the Select

06:25: menu, choose Modify, and choose Smooth, and 
then I will enter a Sample Radius value of

06:29: 2 pixels here. And you can 
see, there's no preview;

06:32: I just have to hope for the best, 
and click OK.

06:35: That's probably going to 
end up working out nicely.

06:36: I will Shift+Click on the layer mask to turn 
it back on, so we can see the results of that

06:41: mask, and I will press Control+Backspace, or Command+
Delete on the Mac, to fill the selection with the

06:46: background color, which is white for me. And then 
I will press Control+Shift+I or Command+Shift+I,

06:51: as long as I am working with keyboard 
shortcuts, to reverse the selection.

06:54: So I've got the area outside 
of the marching ants selected.

06:57: I will press and hold the Shift and Alt keys, 
or the Shift and Option keys on the Mac, and

07:01: I will drag around this little area right 
there in order to select that region, and

07:06: I will press Alt+Backspace, or Option+Delete 
on the Mac, to fill it with black, so that the

07:11: sunglasses are in better shape. And I should 
probably just go ahead and select this region

07:15: at the top of the nose as well, like so, and 
I am Alt+Clicking or Option+Clicking with

07:19: the Lasso tool to, draw that polygonal 
selection outline and I will press Alt+Backspace, or

07:23: Option+Delete on the Mac, to fill it with 
black, and we have a better edge there.

07:28: All right, let's check out what else 
we've got to work with here.

07:30: I will Alt+Click or Option+Click on the layer mask 
thumbnail to view the layer mask independently of the image.

07:35: It looks like we need to firm up that stuff.

07:37: So I will press the B key in order to switch to 
my Brush tool, right-click inside the image,

07:42: crank the Hardness value down to 0%, press 
the Enter or Return key to hide that panel.

07:47: And this time, I'm going to 
switch to the Soft Light mode.

07:50: So if you find the Overlay mode is too much, 
don't reduce the Opacity value; instead, switch

07:55: to Soft Light, so you can make 
more subtle modifications.

07:59: Then I will go ahead and paint in 
that region in order to paint it away.

08:03: Let's try out a few more adjustments.

08:05: So I will go ahead and press 
Control+0, or Command+0 on a Mac,

08:08: to zoom out from the image. I will Alt+Click 
or Option+Click on the layer mask thumbnail,

08:12: so I can see the image at 
the same time as the mask.

08:14: I am still editing the mask, however, and I am 
going to press the X key to switch my foreground

08:19: color to white, and I am going to 
paint back in some of his hair.

08:22: So I am just painting along 
the back of the hair, like so.

08:25: Then finally, we've got these weird edges 
right there inside the hair, and I will Alt+Click

08:30: or Option+Click on the layer mask, so you can 
see what I am talking about. A bunch of weird

08:33: little sort of snivels that are 
showing up here in front of his 'do.

08:37: So I will right-click inside the image window.

08:38: I am going to take that Hardness value up 
to 75%, press the Enter key, or the Return

08:43: key on a Mac, to hide that panel.

08:45: Then I will press Shift+Alt+N, or Shift+Option+N on 
the Mac, to switch back to the Normal blend mode.

08:50: I will reduce the size of my cursor, and 
paint some of this stuff away, like so.

08:55: Now, that may have kind of 
messed up the mask a little bit.

08:57: So I will Alt+Click or Option+Click on that 
layer mask thumbnail again, and sure enough,

09:02: I am bringing back some 
of that bad background.

09:04: So I am going to press Control+Alt+R, or Command+Option+R 
on a Mac, to bring up the Refine Mask dialog box.

09:11: And this time, I am just going to paint in 
a little bit of edge detection using that

09:15: Refine Radius tool, which is selected automatically, 
and I will just paint in this region, like

09:21: so, and release, and that goes ahead 
and restores the blue background.

09:25: Then I will click OK in 
order to accept that change.

09:29: Now let's just take a tour of things.

09:31: I will Alt+Click or Option+Click on the layer 
mask thumbnail, so that we can view the layer

09:35: mask independently of the image, and then I'll 
just kind of tour around the edges to make

09:39: sure we got everything.

09:40: This looks pretty good.

09:41: We can probably make that edge a little 
better, but I'm not too worried about it.

09:45: If you end up with some overly sharp edges, by 
the way, such as in this area, here is what

09:51: you do; Alt+Click or Option+Click on the layer 
mask thumbnail, so you can see the image at

09:54: the same time, and switch to the Blur tool.

09:57: And you can get the Blur tool 
from this flyout menu right there.

10:00: If you loaded my dekeKeys keyboard shortcuts,
it's also available by pressing the N key.

10:05: I will reduce the size of my cursor a little 
bit, and then I will go ahead and paint along

10:08: the lips, like so, and I will 
paint down his chin as well.

10:13: We end up with what I consider to be some more 
naturalistic, organic transitions right there.

10:18: Paint along the top of his nose as well.

10:21: Otherwise, I think we're in pretty good shape.

10:23: I might paint along the top of his forehead.

10:24: It's really just the front of his 
face that was in kind of rough shape.

10:28: And be sure, by the way, very important that 
you're painting inside the layer mask, not

10:32: inside the image, otherwise you will end up 
blurring the details inside the photographic

10:36: image, which is definitely 
not something you want.

10:39: That's how you make manual modifications to a 
layer mask by overlay painting with the Brush

10:44: tool; that is, setting the Brush tool to either 
the Overlay or Soft Light blend modes, as well

10:49: as how you view the image and the layer mask, 
either independently, or at the same time here

10:54: inside Photoshop.


 ** Combining Quick Selection with Refine Mask

00:00: In this movie, we are going to takes this 
guy's sunglasses, along with his shirt, and

00:03: his jacket, all of which have a red hue associated 
with them, and we are going to turn them blue,

00:08: so that they better match the scene.

00:09: And we are going to do so using a combination 
of the Quick Selection tool, along with Refine

00:15: Edge. And the reason I'm pairing these two 
features is because they were introduced into

00:19: Photoshop at the same time, and as a 
result, they work together quite nicely.

00:24: So we'll start off inside this image here, 
zoom in on it, and I will go ahead and select

00:29: the Quick Selection tool. In my case, I have 
to click and hold on the Magic Wand tool, and

00:32: then select the Quick Selection tool from 
the flyout menu. And you want to make sure

00:36: that the Auto Enhance checkbox is turned on, so 
that you get the possible results out of the tool.

00:41: All right, I am going to increase the size 
of my brush to about 15 pixels, and then I

00:46: will go ahead and paint 
inside of the sunglasses, like so.

00:49: Now, you will have to be patient, because this 
is going to require multiple passes of this

00:54: tool. So notice I am just painting a little 
bit at a time, because if you go too far, you

00:58: will probably go way too far very quickly.

01:01: All right, so now I'll paint down into the bottom 
portion of glasses, I'll paint around into the

01:05: front as well, and that looks pretty good; 
looks like I have to get some more at the very

01:10: front of the glasses, and at this point,
I am just clicking with this tool.

01:14: All right, now I will reduce the size of the 
my cursor, and paint into the sidebar, and I

01:19: have gotten too much detail, so I will press 
the Alt key, or the Option key on the Mac, and

01:24: drag in the flesh tones in order to deselect 
them, and this I guess looks pretty good where

01:29: the sunglasses are concerned.

01:30: We will be able to gauge the results better in 
just a moment after we apply a Hue/Saturation

01:35: adjustment layer.

01:36: All right, here is where 
things really get tricky.

01:38: I will increase the size of my cursor, and 
then paint inside the shirt, and the jacket

01:43: over here on the left-hand side of the guy, and I'm 
going to paint up way too far, as you can see.

01:48: All right, so that ends up selecting into his 
neck; I will come back to that in a moment.

01:51: I missed a detail down here.

01:53: So I will click, and I will Alt+Click over on 
the other side in order to get rid of that,

01:57: Alt+Click up here in order to get rid of that 
bit of blue that I selected, and now I will

02:01: try Alt+Dragging down along his neck, but 
that ends up deselecting a lot of the collar.

02:06: So I guess I will go ahead and zoom in.

02:08: That's the thing about 
the Quick Selection tool;

02:10: it's not easy to predict its outcome. And I 
will go and drag in that upper region of the

02:15: collar with a very small brush, as you see 
me doing here, and I may just click of few

02:19: times in order to see what I can get. And 
that looks like a pretty ratty edge, so I will

02:24: go ahead and drag inside of the 
collar just a little more right there.

02:28: All right; so far, so good, I guess.

02:30: Again, it's hard to tell from 
just seeing marching ants.

02:32: I will go ahead and drag over here in the 
far upper left corner of the shoulder.

02:38: Now let's go ahead and grab the other shoulder, 
as well as the other collar, by dragging inside

02:42: of it with a larger brush, then I will reduce 
the size of my cursor to something very dinky --

02:47: about seven pixels -- and drag up into this 
region of the collar, and see what I get.

02:52: I selected a little bit too much, so I will 
Alt+Drag or Option+Drag, like so, in order to

02:57: deselect that region, and I need to drag 
inside of that portion of the collar --

03:02: your results will probably vary -- in 
order to achieve this result here.

03:06: You know, just right there, I might be able 
to Alt+Drag with a very tiny brush inside

03:12: of this detail here, so I don't accidentally 
color the flesh tones inside of his buttonhole.

03:18: All right, that looks like it's 
a good place to start, I guess.

03:22: With this selection active, I'm going to drop 
down to the black/white icon at the bottom

03:25: of the Layers panel, Alt+Click or Option+
Click on that icon, and choose Hue/Saturation in

03:31: order to bring up the 
Hue/Saturation dialog box.

03:33: If you loaded dekeKeys, you can also press 
Control+Shift+U, or Command+Shift+U on the Mac.

03:38: I am just going to call this layer blue, and 
click OK, and you know what? I need to figure

03:43: out what color I want to use here.

03:45: So I will press the I key in 
order to get my Eyedropper.

03:48: But because the layer mask is active, I will 
only be able to select shades of black and

03:51: white, so I am going to click on this sky 
layer to make it active, and then click in

03:55: some region of the sky, like so, in order 
to lift that color as a foreground color.

04:00: In my case, it's got a Hue 
of 209 degrees, and so forth.

04:04: All right, let's switch back to the Hue/Saturation 
layer, turn on the Colorize checkbox, and had

04:09: I done that in advance of creating the layer, 
Photoshop would have gone ahead and automatically

04:14: grabbed that Hue value, but I didn't, so 
I will go ahead and dial it in manually.

04:17: It was 209, but I am just going to round it 
off to 210, and then I will take the Saturation

04:21: value up to 50%, like so,

04:24: more so I can see what I am doing 
than that I necessarily like this affect.

04:28: All right, then I will 
hide the Properties panel.

04:30: Now we need to adjust the mask, and I will 
start off here by pressing the B key to get

04:35: my Brush tool, and I will right-click inside 
the image window, and I am going to change

04:38: that Hardness value back to 75%, and 
then I will reduce the size of my cursor.

04:42: I want to make sure black is my foreground 
color, so I had to press the X key to make

04:46: that happen. And with my layer mask active 
for this Hue/Saturation layer, go ahead and click

04:51: right about there in order to paint that area 
away, so that we are not leaking too much blue

04:56: into his hair. And then 
actually I want to zoom back in.

05:00: Press the L key to switch the Lasso 
tool, and Alt+Click around this area.

05:04: This would be Option+Clicking on the Mac in 
order to select that bridge of the nose, and

05:08: press Alt+Backspace or Option+Delete to fill 
it with black, so that we have a nice corner,

05:12: and we are not painting the flesh blue, 
which is really not something I want to do.

05:15: All right, this is looking 
to be in pretty good shape.

05:18: It looks like I need to grab a little bit 
of additional detail right there, and I am

05:21: just dragging around it, and I will press Control+
Backspace, or Command+Delete on the Mac, to fill that

05:26: region with white, 
because I want to mask it in.

05:29: All right, let's Alt+Click or Option+Click 
on a layer mask thumbnail, so we can see the

05:32: mask independently, and you can see that it's 
okay, but it's a little bit ratty in places.

05:38: Actually, my sunglasses 
are in pretty good shape.

05:40: It's mostly this collar region 
that's a little bit shabby.

05:43: So what I am going to do is Alt+Click or Option+
Click again, so I can see the layer mask and the

05:48: image at the same time, and I will go up to 
the Select menu, and choose Refine Mask to

05:52: bring up the Refine Mask dialog box.

05:54: And you can fool around with 
these settings as much as you like.

05:57: I am actually going to switch my view back 
to Black & White, so I can see the layer mask

06:00: on its own. And you may ask, well, then why 
weren't you just looking at the layer mask like you

06:04: were a second ago?

06:05: Why did you bring the image back into view? And the 
reason is, you get more accurate feedback this way.

06:10: So I am going to take that Smooth value up,

06:13: let's say, to 10 in order to smooth out those 
details quite a bit. And then I will take

06:18: the Radius value,

06:19: I found, up to 3 ended up doing pretty good, 
although that ends up backing off my edge

06:25: a little bit, so I am going to take the Smooth value 
down to 5, and let's see what we end up getting.

06:30: I am going to switch back to On Layers from that 
View menu, and that actually looks pretty good.

06:37: What I might want to do is shift the edge out,
so I will press Shift+up arrow a few times

06:42: to take that Shift Edge value up to +50, so 
that I am getting all of the jacket -- that looks

06:48: good -- and I am getting all of the glasses, and 
I am not spreading the glasses out too far.

06:52: I like that.

06:53: All right, so these are my values: 3 for Radius,
5 for Smooth, and Shift Edge +50. Click OK,

07:00: and I might want to go ahead and switch back 
to my Brush tool, and I will make sure that

07:04: my foreground color is black, which it is, and 
I am going to click right there in order to

07:07: get rid of some of that extra 
blue that was on his face.

07:10: Click, and Shift+Click along that temple, 
reduce the size of my brush cursor, click and drag

07:17: right down there, and then click and Shift+Click 
along the bottom edge of the temple. I

07:22: just want to make sure I am not making any of his 
flesh blue, so I will bring my cursor around here.

07:26: I am just clicking and dragging in a few places.
Oh! I ruined that corner at the bridge

07:31: of the nose, so I will press the L key in 
order to get my Lasso tool, Alt+Click around

07:36: this area, that's an Option+Click on the Mac, 
to draw a polygonal selection outline. Fill

07:40: that with black by pressing Alt+Backspace, 
or Option+Delete on the Mac.

07:43: It looks like I got a little bit of junk 
up here too; click and Shift+Click along the

07:47: top of the glasses. Maybe drag 
along the top of them as well.

07:51: Better not to paint too much 
of his flesh blue I think.

07:55: All right, assuming that I am happy with 
what I see, I will go and zoom out by pressing

07:59: Control+0, or Command+0 on the Mac. And then I 
figured, you know what? I want to keep the

08:03: natural saturation variations inherent in the 
image, so I will press the M key to switch

08:08: my Rectangular Marquee tool, and then I will 
change the blend mode from Normal to Hue.

08:13: You can also get the Hue mode by pressing 
Shift+Alt+U, or Shift+Option+U on the Mac, and

08:18: that makes a tiny modification.

08:20: If I press Control+Z, or Command+Z on the Mac, 
this is the way the shirt and jacket looked

08:24: before, and then if I press Control or Command+Z 
again, you can see that we have more natural

08:29: saturation variations.

08:30: And now I am going to press the 7 key in 
order to reduce the Opacity to 70%, and that ends

08:37: up making things look a little bit too violent, 
so I am going to double-click on the adjustment

08:41: layer thumbnail right there in order to bring 
up the Properties panel, and I will click inside

08:45: the Hue value, and press Shift+down arrow twice 
in order to reduce that Hue value 290 degrees,

08:51: which, when mixed with the natural redness of 
the image, ends up producing a better effect.

08:57: All right, now I will hide the Properties 
panel, and it looks like this area needs a

09:01: little bit of adjustment, so you 
know what? I am going to cheat.

09:04: I am going to grab my Lasso tool, which, of 
course, I can get by pressing the L key.

09:08: I am going to select this region of the image, 
and I am going to switch to the layer mask,

09:12: so I will click in the layer mask thumbnail to 
make it active, and then I am going to press

09:16: Control+Alt+right arrow or Command+Option+right arrow, 
and that just goes ahead and scoots that area

09:21: of the mask over one pixel, so you can 
see that made a pretty big difference.

09:25: I might press a right arrow key again in 
order to shift things over just that much more.

09:29: Then I will press Control+D, or Command+D 
on the Mac, to deselect the image.

09:32: I will grab my Brush tool, which 
I can get by pressing the B key.

09:35: Let's see. I am painting with black;

09:37: that's what I want, so I will just paint up 
this area right there. And then I will press

09:41: the X key, because I have a little bit of a 
hitch that I created by nudging that portion

09:44: of the mask, so I will press the X key 
to make the foreground color white.

09:48: Now click right there, and Shift+Click right 
there in order to add in a little bit of a

09:53: collar, and have a straight edge. And then, if 
I am feeing really persnickety, press the L

09:57: key to switch back to Lasso tool, Alt+Click 
or Option+Click around this little corner

10:01: right there, and then press Control+Backspace, or 
Command+Delete on the Mac, because my background

10:06: colors is now black, to fill that region with 
black. Then press Control+D, or Command+D on

10:11: the Mac, in order to deselect the image.

10:13: All right, so I will zoom out by 
pressing Control+0, or Command+0 on the Mac.

10:17: This is what the image looked like before, 
with the red collar, and the red glasses, and

10:21: the reddish jacket, and this 
is what it looks like now,

10:24: thanks to the addition of this Hue/Saturation 
adjustment layer that I was able to mask, very

10:29: carefully, of course, using a combination of 
the Quick Selection tool, along with the Refine

10:34: Mask command.


 ** Bolstering and integrating hair

00:00: In this movie, we are going to complete the 
composition, and the first thing we're going

00:04: to do is firm up some of the details inside 
of the hair, because it's a little fragile

00:08: at this point, and then we'll go ahead and 
weave this text into the hair in order to

00:12: achieve this final effect.

00:14: So, for starters here, I am going to zoom in 
on his hair, and the problem is that the hair

00:19: is ending up a little more fragile than it 
was, certainly inside the original image.

00:24: So, for example, we have these choppy details 
upfront, and then we've got some wayward hair

00:28: up at the top as well.

00:30: I think we can make things look better 
with the addition of another layer.

00:33: So the first thing I am going to do is 
click on this side view layer to make it active,

00:37: and then I am going to Alt+Drag or Option+Drag 
it to duplicate the layer, and drop it on top

00:42: of the blue adjustment layer. And that 
already makes the hair look firmer, just by virtue

00:48: of the fact that it's repeated a couple of 
times, so this is the hair as it was a moment

00:51: ago, and this is the hair as it looks now.

00:54: Problem is, we are also 
bolstering the beige background.

00:57: We don't want that. And we have gone ahead 
and replaced all the work inside the sunglass

01:01: lenses, and inside the collar as well.

01:04: So we need to change the blend mode to that 
one blend mode that keeps all the luminance

01:08: inside the active layer, but it gets 
rid of the color, and that is Luminosity.

01:13: So go ahead and select that mode, or you can press 
Shift+Alt+Y, or Shift+Option+Y on the Mac, and now

01:19: if I turn the layer off, and then turn the 
layer back on, you can see that we are not

01:23: modifying the color;

01:24: we are just bolstering the amount of hair.

01:27: All right, so I am going to go ahead and call 
this layer luminance, because that's what it

01:31: is, and I'm going to brush in still more hair 
by switching to the Brush tool. And I will

01:37: right-click inside the image window, so you can see 
I have cranked the Hardness value down to 0%.

01:41: Now let's go ahead and click on the 
layer mask thumbnail to make it active.

01:46: White is my foreground color by default, so 
I will increase the size of my cursor, and

01:50: then I will just go ahead and paint hair in 
around the top of the image, and in front of

01:54: the hair as well, and then down 
across the back a little bit.

01:58: Now, what that does is it introduces a 
bunch of haloing that, of course, I don't want.

02:02: So I will double-click on an empty portion 
of this layer to bring up the Layer Style

02:06: dialog box. You may recall those luminance 
exclusion sliders from a couple of chapters back.

02:12: I am going to take the white triangle for 
the This Layer slider, and drag it down to,

02:17: let's say, about 170, which ends up getting 
rid of most of that haloing, but you can see

02:22: we have a bunch of stray hair 
details as well if I zoom in here.

02:26: So I will press the Alt key, or the Option 
key on the Mac, and drag the left half of that

02:31: white slider triangle down to about 130.

02:35: I think that works out pretty nicely, because 
if you take any father down than that, then

02:39: you end up losing some of the dark hairs.

02:41: All right, so that looks good.

02:43: Click OK. It looks a little bit choppy

02:45: this close up, but as soon as we 
zoom out, that choppiness goes away.

02:49: All right, so it's a subtle difference, but 
this is what the image looked like before

02:53: I added that additional hair layer, 
and this is what it looks like now.

02:57: So his hair is just fuller, which is more in keeping 
with the way it looked in the original photograph.

03:01: All right, now let's grab that 
rad rules layer; turn it on.

03:05: It's a shape layer, as you can see here, so 
you are going to see some shape outlines.

03:08: I converted it to a shape layer, just because 
you may not have that same font, Cooper Black,

03:13: loaded on your system.

03:14: Go ahead and press the M key to switch back to 
the Rectangular Marquee tool, and I am going

03:18: to drag the rad rules layer to below this guy, 
so that his hair is covering up the letters.

03:24: I'll also press Control+H, or Command+H on 
the Mac, so I don't see those edges.

03:28: But I really want the letters to look like 
they are coming out of the hair, as in the

03:32: final composition, so I need another copy 
of the text layer, and I will create it by

03:37: Alt or Option-dragging that shape layer up to the 
top of the stack, like so. That creates a copy.

03:44: Let's go ahead and reduce the Fill Opacity; 
switch back to the Rectangular Marquee tool

03:47: if you haven't already done that, and then 
press Shift+00, and that will take the Fill

03:51: Opacity down to 0%. But we also want to clip 
this layer to the luminance layer below it,

03:57: so that we are just seeing the letters inside 
the hair, so press the Alt key, or the Option

04:01: key on the Mac, and click that horizontal line 
between the two layers, and we end up getting

04:05: this weird effect right here, where we can 
see just a little bit of the edges, which are

04:11: created using a combination of Inner Glow 
and Outer Glow, and we can see just little bit

04:15: of those edges inside the hair.

04:17: They are very, very thin. 
What is going on?

04:19: Well, problem is -- I'll switch back to the 
luminance layer, and double-click on an empty portion

04:24: of that layer to bring up 
the Layer Style dialog box.

04:27: The culprit is the This 
Layer slider right there.

04:30: If I were to crank it back up, then the 
letters look the way they're supposed to,

04:33: but as soon as I start taking that second 
value down, as I had previously, why then we

04:39: start getting the problem, and that's because 
both of these layers are being merged together

04:44: before they're being mixed with 
the rest of the composition.

04:47: You may recall, a couple of chapters back, I 
was telling you that these checkboxes are

04:51: designed to be problem solvers.

04:53: Notice this one that says, 
Blend Clipped Layers as Group.

04:56: That's the culprit.

04:57: It's making sure that the layer effects are 
being blended according to the This Layer setting.

05:02: If I turn the checkbox off, then we end up 
getting a much better effect. Now click OK.

05:07: Finally, I want to make the letters look like 
they are emerging from the hair, and I will

05:12: do that by switching back to that top rad 
rules layer; double-click on an empty portion

05:16: of it to bring up its Layer Style dialog box, 
and Alt+Drag or Option+Drag the right half

05:23: of this black underlying layer triangle 
until you get a value after the slash of 100 is

05:30: what I'm looking for here.

05:31: There; I got it. So 0/100 for Underlying Layer, 
and you get the effect of the text being mixed

05:38: in with the dark hair, then click 
OK in order to accept that affect.

05:42: I will go ahead and press the F key a couple 
of times in order to switch to the full screen

05:46: mode, and there you have it! My final 
composition achieved using a combination of the Refine

05:54: Edge command -- or Refine Mask, if you prefer -- 
combined with a handful of layer masking and

05:59: compositing techniques here inside Photoshop.


 ** The Pen tool

00:00: The masking techniques that I demonstrated in 
the previous chapters are great for selecting

00:05: filigree details, such as hair, but they 
don't always work out as successfully for

00:10: smooth, well-defined contours, such as those associated 
with faces, man-made objects, and products shots.

00:18: Enter the Pen tool.

00:19: This elegant, but demanding drawing tool allows 
you to trace any smooth, well-defined contour

00:25: on a point by point basis.

00:28: Like the Shape tools that I review back in 
the Intermediate Course, the Pen tool draws

00:32: a vector-based outline,

00:34: but instead of creating a shape layer, it 
results in a free-form path that you can use

00:39: to select portions of an image.

00:42: For example, let's say I 
want to select this glass.

00:45: I'll click here with the Pen to 
create what's known as a corner point.

00:49: Then I'll click here to create another one.

00:53: Photoshop automatically connects the points 
with a straight segment, just as you would

00:57: with a connect the dots puzzle.

01:00: That segment ends up shaving off 
the side of the glass, however.

01:03: So I'll click with the Pen to add 
another point right here in the middle.

01:09: This is a smooth point.

01:11: Now I'll scoot the point over, and you can 
see how the smooth point adds curvature to

01:16: the neighboring segments.

01:19: See these levers coming off the point?

01:21: They're called control handles.

01:23: Notice, if I drag a handle, the other handle 
moves in the opposite direction, and both segments

01:29: curve in the directions of the handles.

01:32: It's like the handles are magnets, 
and the curves are attracted to them.

01:37: The Pen tool requires skill, determination, 
and a fair amount of manual labor, but in

01:42: the right hands, it's the most capable tool for 
selecting complex surfaces in all of Photoshop.

 ** Pixel-based masking versus the Pen tool

00:00: In this first project, we're going to take 
this open magazine, which featured the first

00:04: words that I ever wrote on the topic of Photoshop, 
and we're going to mask it against this synthetic

00:09: woodgrain background, and we're going to 
do so with absolute precision and control,

00:14: using the Pen tool.

00:16: Now, you might look at the 
magazine, and figure, well gosh,

00:18: you know, it's bright, and it's set against a 
dark background, not altogether uniform,

00:22: but certainly we could end up masking it using 
a combination of Color Range, and Refine Edge,

00:28: for example. Or we could manually trace 
it point by point using the Pen tool.

00:35: Seems like masking is the better way to go.

00:37: Well, for the sake of 
comparison, let's try it out.

00:40: I'll go up to the Select menu, and I'll choose 
the Color Range command, and I've reestablished

00:44: the default settings, so 
the Fuzziness is set to 40.

00:47: I am going to go ahead and click in the background, 
let's say, and then Shift+drag across the background

00:53: in order to select the entire thing, 
and that's really all there is to it.

00:57: I could then turn on the Invert checkbox, so 
that we are selecting the magazine instead

01:00: of the background, and then click OK.

01:03: And then I would press the Q key in 
order to switch to the Quick Mask mode.

01:06: Press the Tilde key to hide the image, press 
the L key to switch to the Lasso tool, and

01:12: press and hold the Alt key, or the Option key on the 
Mac, as I click around the interior of the magazine.

01:18: I am not going to worry 
about the edges for now.

01:20: I could take care of them later,

01:22: but I just want to make a point here.

01:24: After I complete the selection, I'll press 
Alt+Backspace or Option+Delete in order to

01:28: fill that area with white.

01:30: Press Control+D, or Command+D on 
the Mac, to deselect the image.

01:32: Let's go ahead and grab this garbage over here, 
and I'll press Control+Backspace, or Command+Delete

01:37: on the Mac, in order to fill that with black.

01:40: Then let's go ahead and center the zoom.

01:43: Press the Q key in order to exit the Quick 
Mask mode, and convert the mask into a selection

01:47: outline, and then drop down to the Add layer mask icon 
at the bottom of the Layers panel, and click on it.

01:53: Now, that's a pretty good job so far,
but we do have some ratty edges.

01:58: So I'd go up to the Select menu, and choose 
Refine Mask, and then I'll take the Feather

02:03: value up to, say, 3 pixels, maybe take the 
Contrast value pretty high to something like 70%;

02:09: that gives us a nice edge.

02:11: And then I want to back it off a little, so I'll 
take the Shift Edge value down to about -20

02:16: I think it will do it for us.

02:19: And that ends up creating 
a pretty smooth outline.

02:22: I'll go ahead and click OK in 
order to accept the results there.

02:26: And if I wander around the edges here, I can 
see that I am rounding off the corners a little

02:29: bit in the upper right corner, but down here 
in the lower right corner, things look awfully

02:33: darn good actually, and we've got a nice 
crease there in the middle of the magazine, down

02:38: here at the bottom.

02:39: This corner is a little messed up.

02:40: This corner up here has problems, because we've 
dropped out some of that edge on the left-hand side.

02:46: I'd have to repair that, and we've 
dropped out the upper left corner as well.

02:50: These are all problems I could take care of, 
including this rounded corner right there in the middle.

02:54: I have some kind of rumply edges up here 
at the top, but again, I could address those.

02:59: The thing is, while this is looking pretty 
good, especially for the very minimal amount

03:04: of work that I put into it,

03:06: you don't say that about outlines 
that you create with the Pen tool.

03:09: If you do it right, they look 
absolutely dead on accurate.

03:13: So I'll go up to the Window menu, choose Arrange, 
and then choose Match All, so the other image is

03:18: zoomed and scrolled to the same location, 
and then I'll switch over it, and you can see,

03:22: this is perfection right there.

03:25: We have an absolutely smooth edge.

03:27: We've got a great corner right 
there in the middle of the magazine.

03:30: We've got a wonderful looking corner up left.

03:33: We've got a great edge all the way down.

03:35: Notice I managed to keep that 
dark edge on the left-hand inside.

03:38: We've got great corner work down here 
in the bottom left corner, and so forth.

03:42: And that is the precision 
that afforded to us by the Pen.

03:45: Also, if I go ahead and click on this vector 
mask thumbnail here inside the Layers panel

03:50: in order to make it active, so 
that I can see the path outline;

03:53: it's that gray thing right there.

03:55: I'll go ahead and switch to my black arrow 
tool -- the so-called Path Selection tool -- and

03:59: then I'll click on that path outline, and you 
can see, now I can modify it to any extent

04:04: I like. And if I wanted to drag a point to 
a different location, then I would click and

04:08: hold on the black arrow tool, and switch to 
the white arrow tool, which Photoshop calls

04:12: the Direct Selection tool, click off 
the path outline to deselect it,

04:16: then go ahead and click on that anchor point to 
select it, and I could drag it to a different

04:21: location, and modify it in any way that I 
see fit in order to make it exactly right.

04:27: And that is a great thing about working with 
a Pen. Regardless of what kind of shape the

04:30: image is in, or what kind of contrast you have 
between the foreground element and its background,

04:36: the Pen tool delivers, because you're creating 
one point at a time, and you're in charge of

04:41: where those points lie. All right.

04:43: I am going to switch back to my original image 
here, and press the F12 key in order to revert it.

04:48: Having told you now how great the Pen tool is, I 
want you to know that there are two varieties.

04:52: Pen tool is located right here at the top 
of the stack of vector tools, right above

04:57: the Type tool, and if you click and hold on it, 
you'll see that there are two Pen tools, in fact.

05:02: There's the standard Pen, which requires you to 
lay down a path outline one point at a time.

05:07: It offers very little in 
the way of automation.

05:09: It requires dexterity, and 
skill, and manual labor.

05:13: And then we have a Freeform Pen tool, which 
allows you to just drag around inside the

05:16: image window, and Photoshop 
creates the points automatically.

05:19: So you would think, oh my gosh, the 
Freeform Pen tool is the way to go.

05:22: Well, you may find it to be a really great 
tool, but for masking a precision element

05:27: like this, it's not going to work out 
too well, and let me show you why.

05:30: I'll go ahead and drag around the outline 
of the magazine here, and I happened to be

05:35: working with a Wacom tablet, which is why 
I am getting moderately decent results.

05:40: If you try this with a mouse, very likely 
you'll get very raunchy results. And then I'll go

05:44: ahead and drag all the way around to the beginning, and 
you can see that circle next to the pen nib cursor.

05:49: That's telling me that I am closing the path.

05:52: Now I've got this path outline here.

05:54: Well, it's certainly not something I can use in 
this current state, so I would have to modify it.

06:00: I'll go ahead and switch back from the white 
arrow tool to the black arrow tool here, and

06:04: I'll click on the path outline, and you can 
see that I've got just a ton of anchor points,

06:09: so many, in fact, that it would take me longer to 
modify this path outline than to simply draw a new one.

06:15: I'll go ahead and switch over to 
the final version of my composition.

06:19: Compare that to this path outline right here.

06:21: I'll click on it with the black arrow tool, and 
you can see that we have very few anchor points,

06:25: and every single point is making a real 
contribution to the path outline. In other words, every

06:32: point is essential,

06:33: and that's the kind of result you only get 
by laying down one point at a time using the

06:38: Pen tool. And I am going to show you exactly 
how this tool works, starting in the next

06:42: movie.

 ** Drawing a straight-sided path outline

00:00: In this movie, I will show you the most 
basic thing you can do with the Pen tool, which

00:03: is to create a straight-sided path outline.

00:06: So I will start things off by selecting the 
Pen, which you can get by pressing the P key,

00:10: and then you want to confirm that this first 
option up here in the options bar is set to Path.

00:14: Were it set to Shape, then you would draw a 
shape layer, which would cover up the magazine

00:19: article, and wouldn't really do us any good 
for purposes of masking, whereas when the

00:23: option is set to Path, as by default, you draw a 
path outline, with no fill, or stroke, or anything

00:29: associated with it, and it 
appears inside the Paths panel.

00:33: So I am going to go ahead and switch over to Paths, 
like so, so we can see this path outline emerge.

00:39: You also probably want to make sure 
that you're seeing large thumbnails,

00:42: and to do so, right-click inside the Paths 
panel, and then select Large, and that way

00:47: you can better see what's going on.

00:48: Now I am going to start things off in this upper 
left corner, so I am just going to go and zoom in,

00:53: and I am actually going to zoom in to 200%.

00:56: And I want you to see what's 
going on with my Pen tool cursor.

00:59: Notice, down and to the right of the cursor is 
a little asterisk, and what that shows you

01:03: is that you are going to create a new path 
outline, so whenever you see that cursor,

01:09: be prepared to start a new path.

01:10: I am going to go ahead and click right here 
at this corner to lay down an anchor point,

01:16: and it's a special kind of anchor point known 
as a corner point, because it represents a

01:20: corner in the path.

01:22: Two things to notice now: one, the asterisk 
has disappeared from my cursor, and all I

01:27: have got left is a pen nib, and that shows me 
that I am in the process of drawing a path.

01:32: Also, you'll see over here in the Paths panel 
that I have a new item called Work Path, and

01:37: it contains our single 
corner point. All right.

01:40: Now I am going to click right 
there to set another corner point,

01:42: and because my path is active, as indicated 
by the lack of asterisk next to my cursor,

01:49: Photoshop goes ahead and joins those two 
anchor points with a straight segment. All right.

01:53: Now I will click over, say, right about there, 
and Photoshop goes ahead and connects the

01:57: new point to its predecessor with yet 
another straight segment. All right.

02:01: I am going to continue to just click along 
here, and I might zoom out a little bit too,

02:05: so I can see more of the document.

02:07: Now obviously, these straight segments aren't 
going to accurately represent the curvature

02:12: of this page, but we'll come 
back to that later. All right.

02:15: I'll click right there in order to set a 
corner point in the crease between the two pages,

02:21: and then I'll click to set a 
couple of more anchor points as well.

02:24: And I am going to go ahead and zoom in at 
this location, and click right about there,

02:30: and there, and there to set some more anchor 
points, so that I can accurately represent

02:36: the way those pages are shifting, and you 
can always come back and modify the position

02:41: of the points later.

02:42: And incidentally, as long as the last anchor 
point is active, you can press an arrow key

02:47: in order to nudge it 
into a different location.

02:50: So pressing an arrow key nudges the point in 
1 pixel increments. Pressing Shift+arrow

02:55: nudges the point in 10 pixel increments.

02:57: Now, let's say something goes wrong. For example,
you accidentally click in an empty portion

03:03: of the Paths panel here, and 
you make the path disappear.

03:06: So, to make it reappear, you just go ahead 
and click on that path, and now you move your

03:10: cursor into the image window, and notice, 
you've got an asterisk again, which tells you, if

03:16: you click in a location, you're starting a 
new path outline; you are not connecting to

03:21: the previous one. All right.

03:23: So I will go ahead and press Control+Z, or 
Command+Z on the Mac, to undo that new point.

03:27: How do you reactivate a path?

03:28: Well, the solution is to hover your cursor 
over one of the endpoints; either the first

03:33: point you created, or the last point, and notice 
as soon as you do that you will see a little

03:38: anchor point down and to the right from the 
pen nib, and that shows you that you're going

03:43: to reactivate that point.

03:44: So just go ahead and click on 
it, and you're back in business.

03:47: You can see that your asterisk has disappeared, and you 
will continue to add points to your path outline.

03:53: All right.

03:53: I am going to go ahead and scroll down to 
the bottom here, and click at this location.

03:58: Notice, Photoshop goes ahead and connects 
the two points with a straight segment.

04:01: I will click here, then I'll click down a 
little bit, and let's say that I want a little

04:06: more room between these anchor points.

04:08: Well, I can move the higher of the two points 
upward by selecting it, and I can select that

04:13: point by pressing the Control key, or the Command 
key on the Mac, which gets me my white arrow

04:18: tool on the fly, and then I would 
click on that point to make it active.

04:22: Then I can release the Control or Command key 
to return to the Pen tool, and I'll press

04:26: the up arrow key just to 
nudge it up a little bit.

04:29: And now I'll zoom out, and I want to show you 
something: my path outline remains active.

04:33: I know that, because I am not 
seeing an asterisk next to my pen nib.

04:37: If I click all the way into the crease here 
in the middle of the magazine, Photoshop goes

04:42: ahead and connects the last endpoint -- not the 
selected point, but the last endpoint -- to my new point.

04:49: All right.

04:49: Now I am going to scroll over to left side 
of the document, click here, and here, and

04:54: we will adjust the 
position of these points later.

04:56: And then finally, I want to close the path 
outline by clicking on the very first point I drew.

05:03: And notice, when I hover my cursor over that 
point, I get a little circle, which is telling

05:07: me I am about to close the path.

05:09: And then, when I click on that point, all the 
anchor points disappear, as you can see, and

05:13: I get an asterisk next to my cursor once again, 
which tells me that if I were to click, I'd

05:19: be creating a new path outline. All right.

05:22: The final thing I want to do is name my path.

05:24: Notice, it appears as Work Path in italics.

05:27: That's very dangerous.

05:28: That means that it's a temporary path outline.

05:31: Notice, if I click off the path to deselect it,
and then I start clicking around to draw

05:36: a new path outline, I wiped out my old one 
entirely. And that's the nature of work paths;

05:43: they are only there so long as 
you don't create a new one.

05:45: So I'm going to have to press Control+Alt+Z, or 
Command+Option+Z on the Mac, several times

05:50: in a row until I get my work path back, and 
then to name it, you just double-click anywhere

05:55: on the path outline, and that 
brings up the Save Path dialog box.

05:59: So it's not so much that you are naming the path 
as you're saving it as part of the document.

06:04: So I will go ahead and 
name mine magazine outline.

06:07: Then click OK in order to save that path, 
and now if I click off the path outline, and

06:13: draw a new path, it becomes a new work path, and my 
previous path outline is preserved.

06:20: I don't want that path, so I am just going 
to grab it, and throw it away by dragging it

06:23: to the trash icon in the 
bottom right corner of the panel.

06:27: Now, one more great thing about path outlines 
is you can save them with any kind of document.

06:32: So they're not like layers, and alpha channels, and 
all the other special things that Photoshop can do.

06:38: You can save path outlines with a TIFF file, 
or a JPEG file, or any other file format.

06:45: So they're extremely flexible, and 
they take almost no room in memory.

06:48: Anyway, I'll go ahead and click on that path 
to reselect it, and that's how you create a

06:53: straight sided path outline by laying down a 
series of corner points using the Pen tool.

 ** Moving, deleting, and adding anchor points

00:00: In this movie, I will show you how to edit an 
existing path outline by dragging and nudging

00:05: points to different locations, as well as 
deleting anchor points, and adding new ones.

00:10: Now, your primary method for editing 
path outlines are your arrow tools.

00:15: So if I Click and hold on this black arrow, 
we have got the Path Selection tool, which

00:18: selects entire paths.

00:20: I call it the black arrow tool, 
because that's what it looks like.

00:24: And we've got the Direct Selection tool, which allows 
you to select and modify independent anchor points.

00:29: I call it the white arrow tool, because that's what it 
looks like, particularly after you select the tool;

00:36: you can see the cursor 
appears as a white arrow.

00:39: And even Adobe thinks of them as being the 
arrow tools, because it went ahead and assigned

00:42: the keyboard shortcut of A for arrow.

00:45: So you can press the A key to select whichever 
is the last arrow tool you used, or you can

00:50: switch between the two arrow tools by 
pressing Shift+A, as you can see here.

00:55: So Shift+A switches me to the white arrow 
tool, and then Shift+A switches me back to

00:59: the black arrow tool.

01:00: If I click on this path outline here with the 
black arrow tool, then I am going to select

01:05: the entire thing, which is great

01:07: if you want to move the entire path to a 
different location, or otherwise modify the whole thing

01:11: at a time, but we need more control than that.

01:14: We need to be able to move the 
anchor points independently.

01:17: So I am going to press Control+Z, or Command+Z 
on the Mac, to undo that movement.

01:21: I am going to go ahead and zoom in here, and I 
am going to press Shift+A in order to switch

01:25: over to the white arrow tool.

01:27: Now, at this juncture, to select an 
independent point, you are going to have to click off

01:31: the path outline to deselect it, and then click 
on the path outline again to make it active.

01:37: Now that I have access to the independent 
anchor points, I can go ahead and drag them

01:40: around, like so, and I can move any 
of the points I want, of course.

01:44: I am going to click on this guy on the center, 
and nudge him down a little bit by pressing

01:48: the down arrow key, a couple of times, and 
then I'll go ahead and toss the image over

01:52: to this point here, and I will click on this 
anchor point, maybe nudge it up a little

01:56: bit, grab this guy, and nudge him up and over, and 
then select this guy, and nudge him a bit as well.

02:03: So notice I am cheating into the magazine, 
because generally speaking, it's better to

02:08: select too little of an image element than 
too much, because if you select too much,

02:13: you'll end up with edge 
fringing from the old background.

02:16: Now when dragging anchor points around, it's 
important that you drag directly on the point.

02:21: If you drag a little off, like so, you'll 
end up dragging the entire segment around,

02:25: as you see me doing here, 
which can be useful, by the way.

02:29: When working with straight-sided paths, you can 
drag entire segments to different locations,

02:35: or if you like, you can 
select a group of points.

02:38: For example, I will go ahead and marquee all 
four of these points here, and then I could

02:42: nudge them as a group by 
pressing the arrow keys.

02:45: All right, I am going to go 
ahead and scroll down here.

02:47: I am just interested in taking care of 
the corners of the magazine at this point.

02:51: We will come back to those curving 
edges of the pages in just a moment.

02:55: All right; that point looks 
like it's in a good location.

02:57: This guy wants to come over a little I 
think. This guy wants to go down to probably

03:02: about here, and otherwise I think we 
have got things where we want them.

03:06: All right, now let's take a look 
at removing and adding points.

03:10: Now, if you select an anchor point, like so, 
and then you press the Backspace key, or the

03:14: Delete key on the Mac, you will not only delete 
the point, but you'll delete both of the segments

03:19: associated with that point, and you'll end 
up leaving a hole in your path outline.

03:24: That's clearly not what I want to do.

03:25: So I will press Control+Z, or Command+Z 
on the Mac, to bring that point back.

03:29: What I would like to do is remove the point 
without creating a hole, and you can do that

03:34: using the Delete Anchor Point tool.

03:36: You don't actually have to select that tool, because 
its functionality is built into the standard Pen.

03:42: So I am going to go ahead and 
select the Pen tool once again.

03:45: And notice this check box 
up here in the options bar:

03:48: Auto Add/Delete, and what that 
allows you to do is the following;

03:52: when a path outline is selected, you can 
hover your cursor over an existing anchor point,

03:57: and click in order to remove it, without 
creating a hole in the path outline.

04:01: I will go ahead and subtract this one as well,
because neither of those points were doing

04:06: me any particular good.

04:08: Notice now, if I hover my cursor over a 
segment, as opposed to an anchor point in a selected

04:13: path, then I get a little plus sign next 
to my cursor, and when I click, I go ahead

04:17: and create a new anchor point.

04:19: And the great thing about this anchor 
point is that it's a smooth point;

04:23: it includes these round control handles on 
either side, and that means that I can add

04:27: curvature to this path outline.

04:29: I will go ahead and click here as well, and 
then I will press the up arrow key in order

04:34: to move that point into the proper location, 
and then I'll press the Control key, or the Command

04:39: key on the Mac, to temporarily access my white 
arrow tool, and I will drag this anchor point

04:44: up, like so. And notice, we now have 
curvature associated with these segments.

04:50: I am not going to modify the 
control handles right now.

04:53: I will show you how to do 
that in the next movie.

04:55: In the meantime, let's go ahead and 
take care of the right-hand page.

04:59: I'll click on each one of these anchor points 
to subtract them, and then I will click along

05:03: the segment in order to add a couple of smooth 
points that are more or less positioned equidistant

05:08: from eachother. And then I will press the 
Control key, and drag this anchor point up; that

05:12: would be the Command key on the Mac, and I 
will drag this guy up as well, to about there.

05:17: And again, we will address the 
curvature of these segments in the next movie.

05:20: All right, now I am going to toss down to 
the bottom of the page here, and I will set

05:24: a point at this location, and another one 
right there, and I will press the down arrow key

05:28: a couple of times in order to nudge that point 
down, and that pretty much takes care of the

05:33: bottom of the page.

05:34: It might need a little maintenance, but not 
much. And then I will set an anchor point

05:38: there, and nudge it down a little bit, and then 
I will set an anchor point at this location,

05:43: and I'll nudge it up a little bit.

05:45: That looks to me like I have pretty well 
taken care of the bottom of the left page.

05:48: I am going to press Control+0, or Command+0 on 
the Mac, to go ahead zoom out, and that's how

05:53: you edit anchor points in 
an existing path outline.

05:56: That is to say, how you move points, how you 
nudge them, how you remove points that you

06:00: don't want; how you add new ones as well.

06:03: In the next movie, I will show you how to 
modify the curvature of the path outline by

06:07: adjusting control handles.

 ** Dragging control handles to modify curves

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to adjust the 
curvature of a path by dragging control handles.

00:05: So the first thing that we want to do here 
is switch to the white arrow tool, and so

00:09: I'll click and hold on the arrow tool, and select 
the Direct Selection tool from the flyout menu.

00:14: Then I'll go ahead and zoom in to 
the top of this left-hand page.

00:18: And notice that we've got a couple of smooth 
points here, and you can identify smooth points

00:22: by clicking on them, and then you'll see the 
anchor points still appear square, because

00:27: they always do inside Photoshop.

00:29: But the point is surrounded by two lines, ending in 
circles, and those circles are the control handles.

00:36: And if you drag one of these circles, you'll 
see a couple of things happen. First of all,

00:40: you're pulling, in my case, at the curvature 
of the segment, and secondly, you're also

00:46: moving the opposing control 
handle in the opposite direction.

00:50: So the control handles operate like a kind of 
seesaw, with the anchor point at the fulcrum.

00:55: The difference is that the seesaw can get 
shorter or longer depending on your needs.

01:01: So notice, if I go with a very short control 
handle like this, then the segment curves

01:06: abruptly right at the beginning,
and then it flattens out.

01:09: If you want to add curvature to that segment, 
then you have to drag the control handle outward,

01:14: so that you have a very long 
lever, as you see here. All right.

01:18: I'm going to go ahead and move this guy down a 
little bit to about this location; looks pretty good.

01:24: And I might press the up arrow key in order 
to nudge that anchor point up, which is going

01:28: to require me to drag this 
control handle down a little bit.

01:31: And by the way, it's the 
anchor point that's selected,

01:34: so if you press the up and down arrow keys, 
you're always going to change the position

01:38: of the anchor point.

01:39: To change the position of a control handle, you 
have to drag inside of the image window. All right,

01:45: now let's go ahead and drag 
this opposing control handle now.

01:48: Once you've gotten one control handle in place,
you have to be very careful when you drag the

01:52: other control handle, because obviously the 
position of the opposite handle is at its

01:57: disposal, because the two are 
locked into alignment with eachother.

02:01: And that's the basic 
nature of the smooth point.

02:03: The fact that they're locked into alignment 
with eachother ensures that you have a smooth,

02:08: continuous curve from one segment into the 
other, so that constraint, wherein moving one

02:15: control handle affects the other one, 
is actually a good thing. All right.

02:19: I'm going to Spacebar+drag the 
image over here a little bit.

02:22: I'll select this anchor point, another smooth point, by 
clicking on it, and then I'll nudge it upward there.

02:27: And I need to drag this control handle over 
to the right a little bit, like so. Then I'm

02:33: going to have to go back to this control handle, and 
ease up on it, so that we're cutting into the page.

02:39: Again, I want to make sure to select too few 
pixels, as opposed to too many. All right.

02:44: Let's go over to this control handle.

02:46: He is a little tougher.

02:47: This is over at the top 
of the right-hand page.

02:49: I'm going to click on it to make it active.

02:51: And incidentally, when you're working with 
curved segments like these, you can drag them

02:56: directly in order to change the 
curvature of the path outline.

03:00: And notice what I have done 
over there on the left-hand side;

03:03: I've added a control handle to what was 
formerly a corner point right there, which turns it

03:09: into what's known as a cusp point, and we'll 
visit those later, but that's really a great

03:13: thing, because it gives me more control.

03:16: And so I can go ahead and drag this control 
handle down, like so, and then I can drag this

03:21: one up, so that I do a better job of masking 
those pixels on the inside edge of that page.

03:28: And then I will go ahead and 
drag this guy over to about here.

03:32: This guy might have come 
up a little bit too far,

03:35: so I might take him down 
to about that location.

03:38: I'm cutting in on this page pretty significantly, 
but I kind of think I need to in order to

03:43: avoid getting any of those dark 
pixels on the edge. All right,

03:46: now let's check out this anchor point. Obviously 
it needs help, so I'll click on it to make

03:51: it active, and then I'll go ahead 
and drag up on its control handle.

03:55: It looks like this guy is a little too 
high for me, so I'll back off of it,

03:59: but I need to make sure that I'm not doing 
any lifting over here on the left-hand side

04:03: of the anchor point.

04:04: It looks pretty good, actually.

04:06: And this area looks to be in good shape too.

04:09: We won't really know if it's exactly 
accurate until we assign the path as a vector mask,

04:13: which we'll do in the next movie, but we can get a 
sense of what's going on right now. All right.

04:18: This guy looks to be in pretty good shape.

04:20: I might drag him up just a little bit, like so.

04:23: And then I'll select this anchor point right 
there, and drag its control handle out, and over.

04:30: If I want just a little bit of additional 
control, I can do that same trick I did before,

04:33: where I drag the segment directly, and that's 
going to go ahead and pull a control handle

04:38: out of that corner in the 
middle of the magazine.

04:41: Now, I'll drag this control handle up and over 
in order to match the curvature of the page.

04:48: And then, so far as the left page is 
concerned, I think we're fine as is.

04:52: I might go ahead and click on this anchor 
point there, and just nudge this control handle

04:56: down a little bit,

04:58: but that ends up lifting up 
on the other side as well.

05:01: That actually looks okay.

05:03: So I'll press Control+0, Command+0 on a Mac, in 
order to zoom out from the image, and I'll

05:07: also click off the path outline, so I 
am no longer seeing the anchor points.

05:11: That is my completed path outline, complete 
with gently curving segments, thanks to my

05:17: ability to drag control handles, as 
well as directly drag curving segments.

05:22: In the next movie, I'll show you how to 
assign this path outline as a vector mask.


 ** 01:45


 ** 02:44


 ** 04:03


 ** 05:01


 ** Converting a path outline to a vector mask

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to convert 
a path outline to a vector-based layer mask,

00:04: which is a little trickier 
than it ought to be, I think.

00:07: And then I'll show you how to adjust 
that mask, so it exactly fits the image.

00:11: So, if you're working along with me, you want 
to make sure that you have your Paths panel

00:15: open. Go ahead and click on the magazine outline 
path to select it, and you'll see this razor-thin

00:21: gray outline tracing around the magazine.

00:23: Now, notice down here, an icon has been added to the 
Paths panel in CS6, and it's this guy: Add layer mask.

00:31: Now, you would think if you click on it, it 
would convert the path to a mask, but that's

00:35: not what happens.

00:36: Instead, if you click Add layer 
mask, nothing changes oscreen.

00:40: What's happened is Photoshop has gone ahead 
and added a blank layer mask to our magazine

00:45: layer, and that's not what we want at all.

00:46: So I will press Control+Z, or Command+Z on a Mac.

00:49: If you want to create a pixel-based mask, 
then you'd return to the Paths panel, and press

00:54: the Control key, or the Command key on a Mac, 
and click on the thumbnail for that path to

00:59: convert the path to a selection 
outline, and deselect the path as well.

01:04: And now if you drop down to the Add layer 
mask icon, and click on it, then you convert

01:08: the selection into a pixel-based mask.

01:10: And you can see, if I switch back to the 
Layers panel, and Alt+Click or Option+Click on the

01:15: layer mask thumbnail, the area that's painted 
white is going to reveal the magazine, and

01:19: the area that's painted black is 
going to conceal the background.

01:23: Now that looks great.

01:24: I have to say, we have a very smooth layer 
mask, but because it's made up of pixels,

01:29: we'll no longer be able to 
edit it as a path outline.

01:32: Now, this can be useful if you want to 
introduce some sort of softness, or fuzziness to the

01:37: mask, or if you want to add a gradient,

01:39: but if you want to maintain sharp outlines, 
and you want those outlines to be scalable

01:45: as well -- say you wanted to up-sample the image, and you 
wanted its edges to remain absolutely razor-sharp --

01:51: in that case, you need a vector mask.

01:54: So I'll press Control+Z, or Command+Z on a Mac, 
to undo the creation of that layer mask, and

01:58: then I'll press Control+D, or Command+D 
on the Mac, to deselect the image.

02:02: Now I'll switch back to the Paths panel, and 
once again select that magazine outline path.

02:08: Here is what you want to do if 
you want to create a vector mask.

02:11: You drop down to the Add layer mask icon, 
either here, or in the Layers panel, and you

02:16: press the Control key, or the Command 
key on the Mac, and click on it.

02:20: And now we've got a vector mask, as warranted by the 
addition of this item here: magazine Vector Mask.

02:27: Magazine, by the way, is the name 
of the active layer. All right.

02:29: I am going to click down here in the empty 
region in order to deselect that path outline,

02:34: and then I am going to 
switch back to the Layers panel.

02:37: And note, by the way, the 
synthetic wood in the background.

02:40: If you're interested in creating this effect, 
then you can check out my course, Deke's Techniques,

02:45: which is part of the lynda.com 
Online Training Library. It's movie 37;

02:49: that is 037, and it's called Creating 
Synthetic Wood Grain. All right.

02:54: Now that we've managed to mask the magazine 
using a path outline, I am going to go ahead

02:58: and zoom in, and check out the details here, 
and you can see we've got a little bit of

03:03: a problem up here at the 
crease at the top of the magazine.

03:07: We've got a kind of dark edge 
on left side of the right page.

03:11: We'll come back to that in a moment.

03:13: Otherwise, things are looking 
to be in pretty good shape.

03:16: This upper right corner looks great. The lower 
right corner looks even better, as you will see here.

03:21: I'll go ahead and scroll my way down.

03:24: This little detail, I think, 
really reads true. All right.

03:26: I am going to zoom out a little bit; scroll over. The 
bottom of the magazine looks to be in good shape.

03:31: The only thing that I'm really having problems 
with is this bright edge on the left-hand side.

03:37: Now, if I shift-click on the layer mask 
thumbnail here inside the Layers panel, that will turn

03:42: the layer mask off, and we do actually have a bright 
edge over there on the left side of the magazine,

03:48: but I don't think it really makes 
sense against this new background.

03:51: So I will go ahead and Shift+Click on the 
vector mask thumbnail to turn it back on, and

03:55: I am going to press the A key to 
switch to my white arrow tool.

03:58: If that gets you the black 
arrow instead, press Shift+A.

04:02: And then, I'm going to click in the corner 
in order to bring up the path outline that's

04:06: associated with this vector mask.

04:08: I'll click again in order to select that bottom 
left anchor point, and then I'm going to scroll

04:13: up to the top left corner, and press the 
Shift key, and click on its anchor points.

04:18: So both the top left, and bottom left anchor 
points are selected, and then I'll press the

04:22: right arrow key a couple of times in order to 
nudge that left edge over. And now I think

04:29: it's looking pretty good.

04:30: I'll go ahead and click on the vector mask 
thumbnail to hide that path outline, and I

04:34: am thinking that's definitely 
looking better. All right!

04:37: Now I am going to scroll in to the top of 
the magazine, because this area is a problem.

04:41: And I'll click some place at the top here with the 
white arrow in order to bring back my path outline.

04:46: I'll go ahead and select this anchor point, 
and I'm going to nudge it down, and possibly

04:51: over to the right, although I'm 
not sure if that looks right.

04:54: I think I'll nudge it back to the left, and 
I'll cheat this control handle inward, like

04:58: so, in order to shave off a little 
bit of the curvature of that page.

05:03: Now let's see how it looks.

05:05: I'll click on the vector mask thumbnail in 
the Layers panel in order to hide the path

05:08: outline, and I would say 
that looks pretty darn good.

05:12: I'll press Control+0, or Command+0 on the 
Mac, in order to zoom out from the image.

05:17: And you know what? Because it's so darn pretty,
I will go ahead and press Shift+F in order

05:21: to switch to the full screen mode.

05:23: And that, friends, is how you create a precision 
path outline that contains both straight and

05:28: curving segments, and then convert it into a 
razor-sharp vector mask here inside Photoshop.

 ** 05:21


 ** Customizing a geometric shape

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to modify a 
geometric shape to create a custom path outline.

00:06: And the idea behind this project is 
we're going to select this droplet --

00:09: once again, this photograph comes to us from 
the Fotolia Image Library -- and we're going

00:13: to send it to a couple of layers; one that 
includes the droplet itself, and another one

00:18: to represent the shadow.

00:19: I created both of these layers 
using path outlines, and vector masks.

00:24: So I'll go ahead and 
switch over to the original photo.

00:27: And the first thing we need to do is pop this 
image onto an independent layer, but I want

00:31: to keep the background.

00:33: If you check out the final version of the 
composition, I have an empty background down

00:37: at the bottom of the stack.

00:39: So there's two ways to 
accomplish this by the way.

00:42: One is tedious, and nonintuitive in my opinion,
and then there's a simpler technique that

00:46: makes more sense.

00:48: The first way of working, which is the more 
typical approach, is to convert the background

00:52: to an independent layer by double-clicking 
on it, and then you call the layer drops, or

00:57: what have you, and click OK.

00:59: So that would be step one.

01:01: The next step is to create another layer that's 
going to service the background, and you can

01:05: just press Control+Shift+N, or 
Command+Shift+N on the Mac, and click OK.

01:09: There's no sense in naming this layer, because 
it's ultimately going to be named Background.

01:14: And then the third step is to tap the D key 
to make sure your background color is white,

01:19: and then go up to the Layer menu, choose New, 
and choose Background from Layer, and that

01:24: goes ahead and converts the 
layer into a static background.

01:28: As I say, to me, that doesn't make a heck 
of a lot of sense, and it's pretty darn and

01:32: tedious, especially if you're 
working your way through a lot of images.

01:35: Here's the better two step approach, and you 
can do the whole thing from the keyboard.

01:39: I'll go ahead and press the F12 key in order 
to reinstate the flat version of the photo.

01:44: And the first step is to press Control+A, or Command+A 
on the Mac, in order to select the entire image.

01:49: And the next step is to send that selection to 
an independent layer, and remove the photograph

01:55: from the background, and you do 
that by pressing mash your fist J.

01:59: So that is to say, Control+Shift+Alt+J on the 
PC, or Command+Shift+Option+J on the Mac.

02:05: Now, here's the rationale behind that keyboard 
shortcut: Control+J or Command+J jumps the layer.

02:10: When you add the Alt key, you force the display 
of the New Layer dialog box, as we have here.

02:15: When you add the Alt or Option key, you force 
the display of the New Layer dialog box, and

02:20: when you add the Shift key, you go ahead and 
transfer the pixels, as opposed to copying them.

02:26: So I'll call this layer shadow, because that 
will ultimately be its purpose, and then I'll

02:30: click OK, and you can see that I've moved 
the pixels to a new layer, and I've gone ahead

02:35: and filled the background with the 
background color, which is white.

02:40: So just those two steps: Control+A or Command+A, and 
then mash your fist J, and you get the job done.

02:45: All right, now I need another copy 
of the layer; the droplet by itself.

02:49: So I'll press Control+Alt+J, or 
Command+Option+J on the Mac;

02:52: this time I don't need the Shift key, and I'll go 
ahead and call this layer drop, and click OK.

02:58: And then I'll turn off the shadow layer;

02:59: we'll come back to it later. All right,

03:01: now let's create a path outline in the form 
of an ellipse, and you do that by dropping

03:06: down to the Shape tool icon, click and hold on it, and 
then select the Ellipse tool from the flyout menu.

03:11: By default, the Shape tools are set 
up to create shape layers, of course.

03:15: We want a path outline, so go up to this first pop-up 
menu in the options bar, and change it to path.

03:22: You'll see that your cursor changes to a 
cross with a little circle around an X.

03:26: Now if you drag with the Shape tool, you'll 
create an empty path outline, as we're seeing

03:31: here, and you want to just more or 
less surround this droplet.

03:34: Obviously, you're not going to exactly match it,
and then release to create a path outline.

03:39: And if you were to switch to the Paths panel, 
you would see that you have new Work Path.

03:43: You probably want to take a moment just to 
go ahead and double-click on it to save that

03:46: path, and I'll name this guy single 
droplet, let's say, and click OK. All right.

03:52: Now I'll switch back to the Layers panel; 
I don't need to see that path anymore.

03:56: Now, assuming that you generally use your Shape 
tools to create shape layers, you might want

03:59: to go ahead and reset that pop-up 
menu in the options bar to Shape.

04:03: All right, now I am going to drop down to the 
arrow tool icon, click and hold on it, and

04:07: select the white arrow tool;

04:08: that is to say, the Direct Selection tool.

04:11: And I'll click someplace on this path outline, 
so that you can see that we have a total of

04:15: four anchor points,

04:17: all of which are smooth points, by the way.

04:19: So I'll click on the one on the left here, 
and you can see that the control handles are

04:23: each equidistant from the anchor point, and 
they're either arranged vertically, as in the

04:28: case of the side points right here, or they're 
arranged horizontally, as in the case of the

04:34: points at the top and the bottom.

04:36: But that doesn't mean 
they have to stay this way.

04:38: As long as you've got the white arrow tool active, 
you can go ahead and click on a segment, for

04:43: example, and then drag the control handles 
to any position you desire. And you can also

04:48: drag the anchor points around as well in order 
to better trace this droplet. And so that's

04:54: what I'm doing, obviously.

04:55: I showed you that you can drag directly on a 
segment in order to change its curvature,

05:00: but notice that it also affects the curvature 
of the neighboring segments; both that segment

05:05: over to the right-hand side, and the 
segment below are being affected by this drag.

05:10: That's not the way it used to be 
in Photoshop CS5, and earlier.

05:13: The surrounding segments were not affected, 
and if you want to restore that behavior,

05:18: you've got a checkbox up here 
that says Constrain Path Dragging.

05:21: If you turn that checkbox on, then you get 
the old behavior, where the control handles

05:26: are locked into their previous alignment, and they 
either get longer, or shorter, but nothing more.

05:32: So that's totally up to you.

05:33: I am going to go ahead and turn that checkbox off, 
because I actually like the new behavior. All right.

05:39: So that's how you transform what was formerly 
a geometric shape into a custom path outline.

05:44: In the next movie, I'll show you how to 
properly position the anchor points, and the control

05:48: handles, and I'll offer a little 
bit of path drawing advice as well.


 ** How to position points and control handles

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to decide 
where your anchor points and control handles

00:04: should be to accurately trace the shape.

00:07: So if you have access to my exercise 
file, I have creating the kind of cheat.

00:11: There is this layer here called points & 
handles, and it's a kind of template for where the

00:15: anchor points and control handles should be 
that I created by taking a screenshot and

00:20: colorizing it red.

00:22: And so if you go ahead and match the template 
by dragging the square anchor points onto

00:26: the square points in the template, and dragging 
the circular control handles, so they match

00:31: the locations of a control handles in the 
template, then you'll end up reproducing my

00:35: path outline, and you'll achieve the 
desired results where this droplet is concerned.

00:41: And notice, as you work your way through things,
obviously we are modifying the position of

00:46: the segments, and their curvature as well.

00:48: So you have to always bear in mind that the 
segment has to travel through the anchor point,

00:53: but it never actually 
touches the control handle.

00:57: The control handle just pulls at it.

00:59: It has this kind of magnetic attraction, and 
it repels the segment as well, as you start

01:04: getting closer to it.

01:05: Then once you pass to the other side of the 
segment, you stretch it in this new direction.

01:10: If you ever get this number here, where you 
twist the segment all the way around, the

01:14: solution is very simple.

01:16: Just drag the control handles all the 
way back to their previous position.

01:20: There is no reason, incidentally, to put, a 
control handle directly on the path outline;

01:25: that doesn't serve you any purpose. In fact, 
it defeats the purpose of the control handle,

01:30: because it's going to flatten out that portion 
of the segment, and if you wanted to do that,

01:34: you wouldn't need a control handle at all.

01:36: All right, so I am going to go ahead and 
drag this guy up to this location right there,

01:41: and then I will drag this control handle in. 
As you are dragging a control handle that's

01:45: associated with a smooth point, always bear 
in mind that you're going to change the angle

01:50: of the opposite control handles as well, 
but you're not going to change its position.

01:54: In other words, it's going to remain the same 
distance away from the anchor point that it was before.

01:59: So we are ultimately departing from the 
previous symmetry that we had when we were looking

02:04: at that perfect ellipse.

02:06: Now, Photoshop displays the path outline by 
inverting the composite image, so if you're

02:11: working along with me, any time you manage 
to exactly match the template, your control

02:17: handles and anchor points are going to turn 
cyan, because cyan is the complement to red.

02:21: Also something to note is that this template 
is designed to look best at the 50% zoom ratio.

02:27: If you zoom in any farther, then it's going 
to look a little bit jagged, but it should

02:32: still serve its purpose.

02:33: All right, I've now managed to match 
every single one of these points,

02:37: so I can go ahead and hide 
my points & handles layer.

02:40: Now, given that we were working from a cheat layer 
here, it's no trick getting the proper results.

02:46: However, you may wonder why in the world I 
chose these locations for my anchor points

02:52: and my control handles.

02:52: For example, why is this guy, instead of being 
centered at the top of the droplet, why is

02:58: he listing over to the right? And why is this 
anchor point over on the left hand side located

03:03: so close to this hairpin curve?

03:06: Well, when you're working with corner points, 
it's pretty easy to decide where those points

03:10: belong, because you are just trying to match the 
corners of the image element that you want to mask.

03:15: But when you're working with smooth points, 
you are always creating continuous arcs.

03:20: So it's a little trickier trying to 
decide where those points need to be.

03:23: I subscribe to a kind of driving analogy.

03:27: So imagine that you're driving along this 
path outline, and for the sake of demonstration,

03:31: imagine you're driving in a 
counterclockwise direction.

03:35: So as you drive along this segment here, the 
road is pretty steady; that is, it's curving

03:40: to a more or less constant degree,

03:42: so you hold the steering 
wheel at a constant angle.

03:45: However, right at this location here, as you 
swoop into the hairpin curve, you need to

03:51: change the angle of the steering wheel, 
specifically you need to angle it more; hopefully, you'd

03:56: slow down as well, and that's exactly where 
you want to put the anchor points: at those

04:00: locations where you're changing 
the angle of the steering wheels.

04:04: So right here, we are steering harder, and as a 
result, the anchor point belongs at that location.

04:11: Doesn't have to be there, by the way; it just 
makes for an easier experience, and a smoother

04:16: experience as well, when you're tracing 
continuously curving image elements.

04:20: Where this anchor point is concerned, imagine 
that you're driving in a clockwise manner,

04:25: because it really doesn't matter which 
direction you are driving; we are just looking, once

04:29: again, for points at which you are going to 
change the angle of your steering wheel.

04:33: And in this case, you want to ratchet up 
the steering right at this position here.

04:38: So while that explains the side points, 
what about the top and bottom points?

04:42: Well the bottom anchor point is located 
pretty much right here at the center of the base

04:47: of the droplet, and this does happen to be pretty 
much the bottommost point to which this curve

04:52: dips. Not so for the top point, however, it's 
over to the right of the apex of the curve,

04:58: and all I have to say for that one is, in 
playing around and experimenting with the position

05:03: of the anchor point, this worked out best.

05:06: So sometimes you just have to rely on 
experience in order to get the job done, and the only

05:11: way to build up that experience, of course, is 
to work with the Pen tool on a routine basis.

05:16: Now let's talk about the control handles here.

05:18: There are two rules where 
control handles are concerned.

05:21: Notice that we have two control handles for 
this curving segment; one as the segment exits

05:26: its top anchor point, and another one as it 
enters the left-hand point. And it really

05:30: doesn't matter which direction the segment is 
traveling, but we essentially have an exit

05:35: control handle, and an entrance control 
handle, and that's the way we want it.

05:39: You either want two control handles for a 
curving segment, or you want zero control handles

05:44: in the case of the straight segment.

05:46: If you have just one control handle for a segment, 
as often as not, it's going to appear lopsided.

05:52: The other rule is that you want the control 
handles together to add up to about two thirds

05:57: of the length of the segment. That's 
going to give you the smoothest result.

06:00: They don't have to be the same length; you 
can see that the left-hand handle is shorter

06:04: than the top one, but together they 
should add up to about two thirds.

06:08: Now, that is a rule of thumb, and you will 
find yourself violating it sometimes.

06:12: Notice, if I click on this bottom left segment 
that the control handles are different lengths,

06:17: which is fine. They don't really add up to 
two thirds of the link of the segment, because

06:21: if they did, I wouldn't be 
accurately tracing the droplet.

06:25: So I will go ahead and press 
Control+Z, or Command+Z on the Mac.

06:28: However, they do add up to more than 50% of 
the length of the segment, which is generally

06:33: essential to get the job done.

06:35: All right, now let's go ahead and convert 
this path outline to a vector mask, and you

06:39: can do that from the Layers panel by dropping 
down to the Add layer mask icon, and just as

06:44: we did in the Paths panel, you press the Control 
key, or the Command key on the Mac, and click

06:48: on it, and that converts 
that path to a vector mask.

06:52: Now I will click on the vector mask to make 
it active, click again in order to hide it,

06:56: and I'll go ahead and zoom in as well. And 
here we have what was originally a perfect

07:00: ellipse tracing a custom, organic 
image element here inside Photoshop.


 ** Drawing smooth points with the Pen tool

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to draw a 
custom path outline made up of smooth points,

00:04: using the Pen tool.

00:05: And just to keep the learning curve as shallow as 
possible, we will go ahead and retrace this droplet.

00:11: So I will right-click on the vector mask 
thumbnail here inside the Layers panel, and I'll choose

00:16: Delete Vector Mask in order to get rid of it.

00:19: And then I'll switch to the Pen tool, 
which you can get by pressing the P key.

00:23: I'll go ahead and start my path 
outline up here toward the top.

00:26: Now, you'll undoubtedly recall that you create 
corner points by clicking with the Pen tool,

00:32: and in each case, the corner point has no 
control handles associated with it whatsoever,

00:38: and as a result, we end up 
getting straight segments. All right,

00:42: I don't want that path outline, so I will 
press the Control key, or the Command key on the

00:45: Mac, to get my white arrow tool.

00:46: Then I will click anywhere on 
the path to partially select it,

00:50: and I will press the Backspace key, or the 
Delete key on a Mac, two times in a row; first

00:54: to get rid of the selected segment, in my case.
That goes ahead and selects the remainder

00:58: of the path, and then you press Backspace or Delete 
again in order to get rid of that path outline.

01:03: All right.

01:04: So clicking creates a corner point; 
dragging creates a smooth point.

01:08: So you click and drag, like so, and the point 
at which you click, that is, where you begin

01:13: your drag; that's the location 
of the smooth point right there.

01:17: And as you drag outward, a control 
handle emerges in both directions.

01:21: So I've got a control handle under my cursor,
and I have a symmetrical control handle in

01:26: exactly the opposite direction.

01:29: Then you go ahead and release in 
order to create that smooth point.

01:33: Now, notice, in my case, that I set my anchor 
point at more or less the 1 o'clock position

01:38: on this droplet, and continuing with the clock 
metaphor, I dragged in the clockwise direction.

01:44: Now, that's not important.

01:46: You can set your points where you think they need 
to be, and you can drag in any direction you like.

01:50: But once you've begun a path outline, as we 
have here -- and you can see that it's active,

01:55: because the pen cursor doesn't have an asterisk 
next to it -- you need to stick with that direction.

02:00: So if you start the path in a clockwise 
direction, then you need to stay clockwise.

02:05: If you start your path in a counterclockwise 
direction, you need to keep drawing it in

02:09: a counterclockwise direction.

02:11: So that means I am going to set a point 
here at about 3 o'clock, and I am going to drag

02:17: clockwise, because if I were to drag in the 
wrong direction -- counterclockwise, in this case --

02:24: I would reverse the curvature of the 
path, and we'd get this inaccurate bend.

02:28: So by virtue of the fact that I am continuing 
clockwise, I am continuing to draw the path

02:33: just as it needs to be drawn.

02:35: One control handle, the control handle that 
doesn't affect anything so far, is under my cursor.

02:41: The opposite control handle is affecting the 
first curve segment that's being laid down.

02:46: And so, by virtue of the fact that I have two 
control handles now, Photoshop is drawing

02:51: a curved segment between my two anchor points.

02:53: Now I will click down here at about 6 
o'clock and drag again in a clockwise direction.

02:59: If I were to go in a counterclockwise 
direction, as if I were to try to control the segment

03:04: that's being drawn, then I would end 
up curving the segment the wrong way.

03:08: So you are actually controlling 
the segmented hand indirectly.

03:12: If you don't get it right, you can always 
go back and make adjustments, and you can

03:16: do that as easily as pressing and holding 
the Control key, or the Command key on a Mac, to

03:19: temporarily get the white arrow tool.

03:22: Then you can click on an 
anchor point to select it.

03:24: You can drag a control handle to 
a different location as desired.

03:28: You could drag directly on a segment if you 
wanted to. Make any modifications you like,

03:33: and then when you are ready to draw again, go 
ahead and release the Control key, or the Command

03:38: key on the Mac, and you will return to your 
Pen tool, and with any luck, the path will

03:42: remain active, as it has 
in my case. All right,

03:44: now I'm going to create a 
point here at 9:30, or so.

03:48: I will drag, again, in a clockwise direction.

03:51: I'm indirectly controlling the 
curvature of the segmented hand,

03:55: and once I get that segment looking 
the way it should, I will release.

04:00: Then finally, I want to go ahead and close 
the path, and I will do that just by clicking.

04:05: So you hover your cursor over the first smooth 
point, and you click, and that will go ahead

04:09: and maintain the control handle that you 
already had associated with that anchor point, and

04:14: curve the segment accordingly.

04:15: Now, it's not going to look right, necessarily.

04:17: You are going to have to 
go back and modify it,

04:20: but you will close the path with a 
nicely curving segment. All right.

04:24: Now we want to adjust this 
path outline, obviously,

04:26: so I will press the A key to switch back to the 
white arrow tool, which is the last arrow I used.

04:32: If you're getting the black arrow tool instead,
then press Shift+A, and now I will click on

04:35: the path outline to select it.

04:37: Specifically, I have clicked on this upper 
left segment, and that allows me to see the two

04:41: control handles associated with that segment, 
without selecting either the neighboring anchor

04:45: points; notice that.

04:47: So now I will go ahead and drag this 
control handle up and over, like that.

04:51: I think this anchor point 
wants to be a little higher,

04:53: so I will click on it, and nudge 
it by pressing the arrow keys.

04:57: Then I will go ahead and drag this guy a little up, 
and I'll drag this guy a little bit farther down.

05:02: So you end up doing a fair amount of backing 
and forthing when you're working with control

05:06: handles inside Photoshop.

05:09: Let's say I'm thinking this looks pretty good.

05:11: Well obviously, the first thing I want to 
do is switch to the Paths panel, and save

05:15: off that work path so I don't lose it.

05:17: So I will double-click on Work Path.

05:20: I'll call this one pen 
tool path, and then click OK.

05:24: Now I want to convert it to a vector mask.

05:25: I am going to switch back to Layers panel, just 
to make sure I have the right layer selected.

05:29: I do, and now I will show you yet another 
way to turn a path into a vector mask.

05:35: You switch to the Pen tool, which again, you 
can get by pressing the P key, and then you

05:40: go up to the options bar.

05:42: We've got some new options 
available to us in CS6.

05:44: There is one called Shape, which allows 
you to convert the path to a shape layer.

05:49: We don't want that.

05:49: There is one called Mask that allows 
you to convert it to a vector mask, as we are

05:54: seeing right here. All right.

05:56: Now let's confirm our work here.

05:57: I will click on the vector mask to make it 
active; that deactivates the path in the Paths

06:01: panel, by the way. And then I'll go ahead and click 
on it again in order to hide the vector mask.

06:07: And I can see down here at the bottom that 
I've got a little bit of kind of an edge,

06:11: and I am not sure if that's 
coming from the background or not.

06:13: And the only way to tell for sure is to Shift+Click 
on the vector mask thumbnail to turn it off

06:17: for a moment, and I can see that, yeah, 
that area was indeed part of the droplet.

06:23: If you want to be able to see the path at 
the same time as the drop, just go ahead and

06:26: click on that vector mask thumbnail.

06:28: And it looks like we've got a 
pretty darn accurate mask actually.

06:32: If anything, I have cut into the droplet a 
little bit, because once again, it's generally

06:37: better to select too little of 
an image element than too much.

06:41: So I will go ahead and zoom out a click.

06:44: And let's say that this area right there;

06:46: I want to capture more of the droplet.

06:48: I'll press the A key to switch back to the 
white arrow tool, and I will click on the

06:52: path outline to select it, and then I'll go 
ahead and drag the control handle out and

06:57: over a little bit, so I 
get more of that droplet.

07:01: So notice that I'm editing the vector mask, even 
though it's not active at the current moment.

07:06: All right.

07:06: I'm going to drag that anchor point up a 
little bit, and then I will go ahead and drag this

07:10: control handle down, because I am trying to 
make sure that we also go ahead and select

07:15: the top of the drop accurately, which means I need 
to move that anchor point up farther even still.

07:22: And this might actually work out.

07:23: I am going to nudge the anchor point over 
and up a little bit, and then I'm going to

07:27: take the wind out of this control handle, so 
that it's not yanking the segment so high.

07:32: Then I might go ahead and take this guy over.

07:34: So every action has an equal and opposite 
reaction, so you may not be able to trace

07:39: the droplet exactly, in which case, again, make 
sure you're cheating into the droplet as supposed

07:44: to out. And then if you want to see the 
results of that vector mask, go ahead and click on

07:49: it first to hide it, and then Shift+Click on 
the vector mask thumbnail there in the Layers

07:53: panel in order to apply it to the 
droplet once again. All right,

07:57: so that's how you go about drawing 
smooth points using the Pen tool.

08:00: In the next movie, we'll create the 
soft shadow, again, using a vector mask.


 ** Duplicating and scaling a vector mask

00:00: In this movie, we'll take our nicely masked 
droplet, and we'll go ahead and give it a soft

00:04: shadow that's organic to the original scene, 
and we'll do so by duplicating, as well as

00:09: transforming, and blurring our existing vector 
mask, and then we'll throw in a pixel-based

00:14: layer mask to boot. All right,

00:16: so starting where we left off, we'll go ahead, 
and turn on the shadow layer to make it active,

00:20: and that's going to bring back the 
entirety of that original image.

00:24: I'll click on the vector mask thumbnail for 
the drop layer here inside the Layers panel,

00:28: so that I can see my path outline.

00:31: And you can either switch to the black arrow 
tool, and click on it to select it, or you

00:34: can select the entire thing with the white 
arrow tool by pressing the Alt key, or the

00:38: Option key on a Mac, and clicking on that path outline, 
and that goes ahead and selects the entire thing.

00:45: Then go up to the Edit menu, and choose the Copy 
command, or just press Control+C, or Command+C on the Mac.

00:51: Now switch to the shadow layer, and let's go 
ahead and give it a vector mask in advance

00:55: by pressing the Control key, or the Command key 
on the Mac, and clicking on the Add layer

00:59: mask icon at the bottom of the panel.

01:02: Then select that layer mask thumbnail to make 
it active, and go up to the Edit menu again,

01:07: and choose the Paste command, or press Control+V, 
or Command+V on the Mac, and that goes ahead

01:12: and pastes that path outline at the 
exact position from which we copied it.

01:17: The problem is, it's set to 
the wrong path operation.

01:19: So go up to the Path operations icon in the 
control panel, click on it, and switch the

01:24: setting to Combine Shapes, so that we end up 
once again masking the droplet. All right.

01:29: I'm going to go ahead, and drag this path 
outline down and a little bit to the left, like so,

01:34: and then, I am going to make it larger by 
going up to the Edit menu, and choosing the

01:38: Command that is now Free Transform Path, or 
you can press Control+T, or Command+T on the Mac.

01:44: You can scale the path outline any way you want, 
but I'm going to work from the numbers here.

01:47: I'll start by selecting the bottom middle reference 
point inside this tiny little matrix right there.

01:53: And then I'll increase the Width Value to 
140%, and I'll take the Height value up to

01:58: 110%, and then I'll press the Enter key, or 
the Return key on the Mac, a couple of times

02:03: in order to scale my path outline. 
All right,

02:06: now I'm going to click off the path to deselect 
it, and I'll select this right-hand point;

02:10: I want to adjust the placement 
of these points a little bit.

02:12: So I'm going to put that guy there, maybe 
drag this control handle down, essentially

02:16: I want to cover a wider 
area in the shadow region.

02:20: This guy is a little bit too far over, 
so I'll move him to about this location.

02:24: I need to bring in that control handle,

02:27: so I'll drag it over, like so, 
and then move it upward as well.

02:30: And then I'll straighten things out down here 
at the bottom of the shape by dragging this

02:34: control handle to about 
right there looks good.

02:37: I'll select the anchor point, so 
I can see this control handle.

02:40: It wants to come out 
farther to about right there,

02:44: so we have a little bit of symmetry 
surrounding this droplet. All right,

02:47: now let's make the shadow soft.

02:49: Now, you can't apply a filter, such 
as Gaussian Blur, to a vector mask.

02:53: And if I were to choose Gaussian Blur, then 
I would apply the blur effect to the pixels

02:57: inside the image layer, 
as opposed to the mask.

03:01: If you want to blur a vector mask, what you 
do is you double-click on the vector mask

03:04: thumbnail to bring up the Properties panel, 
then you have to click that thumbnail again

03:08: in order to make the vector mask active.

03:11: And you increase the Feather value 
in order to apply a blur on the fly.

03:16: I'm going to take that 
Feather value up to 60 pixels.

03:19: This is a parametric effect, so you 
can change your mind anytime you like.

03:23: But 60 pixels works for me, and now I'll go 
ahead and hide the Properties panel. All right.

03:27: I am going to click on the top of the shape 
here, and I'm going to drag this top anchor

03:32: point up a little bit, so you can see that we're 
beginning to reveal the other drops on this leaf.

03:36: We need to mask those out,

03:39: but we can't do so with 
certainty using the vector mask,

03:42: so I'm going to add another layer mask.

03:44: Every layer can support up to one vector-based 
mask, and one pixel-based mask, which is why

03:49: if you drop down to the Add layer mask icon at 
the bottom of the panel, it's still available.

03:54: So just go ahead and click on it, and 
this time, we get a pixel-based layer mask.

03:57: Now I'll switch to the Brush tool.

04:00: If I right-click inside the image window, 
you can see that I've set the Size to 300

04:04: pixels; the Hardness is 0%.

04:06: I'll go ahead and press the Enter key, or the 
Return key on the Mac, in order to accept those

04:10: settings, and I'll press the D key to get 
my default colors, which are white for the

04:13: foreground color, and 
black for the background.

04:16: I want exactly the opposite, so I will press 
the X key in order to make my foreground color

04:20: black, so I can mask these drops away 
just by painting in a big arc across them.

04:26: This should do the trick.

04:27: As soon as you see those drops 
disappear, that should be good enough.

04:30: Now I'll press the A key in order to switch 
back to the white arrow tool, and I'm going

04:34: to take this point down to about this location here, 
so that we have more of a disc underneath the drop.

04:41: I'll drag that left-hand 
control handle farther to left.

04:43: I have got too much of a lump 
on the upper right segment,

04:47: so I'll go ahead and retract the right-hand 
control handle to about this position looks good.

04:52: All right!

04:52: Now I'll click on the background 
layer to hide that vector mask.

04:56: And that is our final effect, folks.

04:58: We'll go ahead and press Shift+F in order to 
switch to the full screen mode, and then

05:02: I'll zoom in on this droplet.

05:04: Let's see if we can see it this large.

05:05: I might want to zoom out a click here 
in order to take in the entire thing.

05:09: And that's how you isolate a natural image 
element against a pure white background using

05:15: nothing but smooth points, along with a little 
bit of layer masking here inside Photoshop.


 ** Cusp points and the Rubber Band option

00:00: In this movie, I'll show you how to create 
the third kind of point that you can make

00:03: with the Pen tool, and that's the cusp point. 
,

00:06: A cusp is a corner between two curve 
segments, or a curve segment and a straight segment.

00:12: And so the idea is that it can contain one 
or two control handles, but if there are two,

00:18: then they are independent of each other.

00:20: And we are going to use a combination of cusp and 
smooth points in order to trace this gentleman's face.

00:25: Now again, he would not be hard to mask. He is dark 
skinned against a light background; what could be easier?

00:31: However, if we were to create a pixel-based mask 
then we wouldn't have super smooth outlines.

00:37: Now, if he had any hair to speak of that was 
going out into the background, then the Pen tool

00:41: would be a bad idea, because the Pen tool does 
not serve us well when working on filigree

00:47: details, but because this guy is super smooth all 
way around, he is ideally suited to the Pen tool.

00:53: Notice I have created another cheat layer, a 
template layer, if you prefer, called points

00:58: & handles, and I will go ahead and turn it on.

01:01: And we can see the points and handles that are 
required to trace this man's face represented in red.

01:07: And this time, because this is a much more 
complex path, the template is designed to

01:11: be viewed at 100% or larger.

01:14: All right, now I am going to press the 
P key in order to select the Pen tool.

01:18: And as opposed to creating a work path, and 
then naming it later, I am going to create

01:22: the path in advance by 
switching over to the Paths panel.

01:25: And incidentally, a single path 
container can contain multiple paths outlines,

01:31: but I want to create a new path entirely by 
dropping down to the page icon, and you can

01:35: either click on it to create an unnamed path, 
or you could Alt+Click or Option+Click on

01:40: that little page icon to bring 
up the New Path dialog box.

01:44: And I'm going to call this path face outline, 
and then I will press the Enter key, or the

01:48: Return key on the Mac.

01:49: And now we wont have to worry about whether 
we've named the path outline later or not, because

01:53: it's already saved in advance of drawing it.

01:55: All right; I am going to start things off at 
this point right here, which occurs at the

02:00: intersection of the guy's chin 
and his sweater in the background.

02:04: And so I will go ahead and drag up from 
that point, like so, to draw a smooth point.

02:09: And you can see that I am going to be 
drawing this path in a clockwise direction.

02:12: Again, it really doesn't matter how you start;

02:14: it matters how you proceed after you begin.

02:17: So I'm establishing a pattern that I'll have to 
continue of tracing him in a clockwise direction.

02:23: All right, so there is my first point.

02:25: Now, I want to show you an 
option that you may find helpful.

02:28: A lot of people swear about it.

02:30: It's available up here in the options 
bar. Click on that little gear icon,

02:34: and you'll see one checkbox called Rubber 
Band, go ahead and turn it on, and then click

02:38: on the gear again to hide that option.

02:41: And now notice that you have this kind of 
rubber band segment that's connecting your

02:44: cursor to the previous anchor point.

02:47: The problem with this view of things is it's 
not quite accurate, because it doesn't account

02:51: for the control handles 
that you're about to draw.

02:54: Notice, if I click to set a corner point with no 
control handle, then my view of that segment

02:59: did not update, because that's what 
it was showing me the first place.

03:03: But if I press Control+Z, or Command+Z on 
the Mac, in order to undo that point.

03:07: And then I click and drag, you can see that that 
fundamentally changes the shape of that segment.

03:13: All right, anyway I'll press Control+Z, or Command+Z on the 
Mac, because that point is not in the right location.

03:19: And I will click here, and then drag, and notice that 
that changes the curvature of the segment as I work.

03:26: And so once again, you may find this Rubber 
Band option helpful, or you may find the fact

03:30: that you're getting inaccurate 
previews to be distracting.

03:33: All right I am going to 
Spacebar+drag up this guy's face here.

03:36: And then I will drag from this anchor point 
up, so again, I'm proceeding in a clockwise

03:41: direction, and then I will drag at 
what's going to be our first cusp point.

03:46: Now, there are couple of 
different ways to make the cusp point.

03:48: I will show you both.

03:49: The first is to click and drag from that 
anchor point right there, and what you want to do

03:55: is you want to match up the angle of the 
opposite control handle, not the one that's under your

03:59: cursor, but the opposite one that's controlling 
the segment that you're actually drawing, and

04:05: then go ahead and release.

04:07: Now, obviously I don't want a smooth point;

04:09: I need a cusp, because his ear is 
coming out of his head at this location.

04:14: So I need to redirect this control handle, 
and you do that by pressing the Alt key, or

04:18: the Option key on the Mac, and then you drag 
from that anchor point, like so, in order to

04:25: sever the relationship 
between the two control handles.

04:28: So now they're going in different directions, 
and this new one can go in any direction you

04:32: like, so I'll position it right there.

04:34: All right, let's drag up his head further 
still, and I will go ahead and drag from this

04:38: anchor point until the opposite 
control handle is in the proper location.

04:41: Then I will release, I will press to Control 
key, or the Command key on the Mac, to access

04:46: my white arrow tool on the fly, and I'll go 
ahead and drag this control handle down, so

04:51: it matches the template once again.

04:52: All right, I am going to zoom in to 200%, because 
I've got a couple of tiny anchor point control

04:58: handle combinations.

04:59: I will drag from this guy to 
this location right there.

05:03: And then I'll drag from here to here, because I am 
trying to trace along that little divot in his ear.

05:09: And now we are going to 
encounter another cusp point.

05:12: Here is the other way create it on the fly,
so that you don't have to drag twice.

05:16: You begin dragging, like so, from that anchor 
point, and you match the angle of the opposing

05:20: control handle -- that's always what you're 
looking to do, by the way -- so that you're accurately

05:24: tracing the top of the ear.

05:26: Then, when you get that handle in the place, 
you press and hold the Alt key, or the Option

05:31: key on the Mac, and now you can move the other 
control handle independently, but you've got

05:35: to keep that Alt or Option key down.

05:37: If you release, like I did, then you are going 
to end up making the opposite control handle

05:42: symmetrical once again, and you are going to 
have to reposition it, like so, and then press

05:46: the Alt or Option key; this time keep it down,

05:50: and independently position 
this control handle here.

05:54: All right, now let's go ahead and scroll up, 
and we've got another point that we need to

05:58: create out here in the pasteboard.

06:00: So I will go ahead and click and drag, like 
so, up here, because we need to trace all the

06:04: way around his head.

06:05: And I am pressing the Shift key as I drag 
to constrain the angle of my control handle

06:09: lever to exactly vertical.

06:12: And when you have the Shift key down, it can be 
any multiple of 45 degrees, so either vertical,

06:16: horizontal, or diagonal; all right. 
I want it to be vertical, however.

06:20: I really don't want to invoke an auto-scroll, 
which I will get if I continue to drag upwards,

06:25: so I am just going to go ahead and release.

06:27: And then I will press and hold the Control key, 
or the Command key on the Mac, and I will drag

06:30: this bottom control handle down, like so.

06:33: And again, I am pressing the Shift key to 
constrain the angle of my drag to exactly vertical,

06:38: and I end up getting this result here.

06:40: All right, so that's how you create cusp 
points in Photoshop, as well as how you make use of

06:44: the Rubber Band function.

06:45: In the next movie, I will show you how to 
establish points out here in the pasteboard.


 ** Setting anchor points in the pasteboard

00:00: In this movie, we'll finish tracing this guy's 
head and shoulders by creating a series of

00:04: anchor points out here inside the 
pasteboard, which is entirely acceptable.

00:09: Your path can be much larger than 
the physical confines of the canvas.

00:13: And along the way, I'll show you how to sever 
off unwanted control handles, as well as how

00:18: to add control handles to corner points.

00:21: So as you can see here, I'm in the middle of 
drawing this path outline, and I've got the

00:24: Rubber Band feature turned on.

00:26: I'm going to go ahead and turn that feature 
off for now -- you can keep it on if you like --

00:31: by clicking on the gear icon, and 
turning off the Rubber Band checkbox.

00:35: And now I'll press Control+0, or Command+0 on 
the Mac, in order to zoom out from the image.

00:40: And take a look at this little thumbnail of 
the path outline here inside the Paths panel.

00:46: You can see it's a little 
sliver of a path filled with white.

00:49: And what's happening is, were I to go ahead 
and convert this partial path outline to a

00:55: vector mask, then Photoshop would treat the 
two endpoints; the one up here at the top

00:59: of the image, and the one down here at the 
intersection of his chin and his sweater, as

01:04: being connected by a straight segment.

01:06: So we just mask off the side of his face.

01:09: That's not what I want, so we need to go ahead 
and completely encircle the guy by creating

01:13: a series of points over here 
beyond the right side of the image.

01:16: Now, I could drag in order to set some more 
smooth points if I just kind of wanted to

01:21: be sloppy, and that would work 
just fine actually, for our purposes.

01:25: But let's say I want to be really super neat and 
tidy, not because I'm compulsive or anything.

01:29: I just want to pass along 
a few more techniques.

01:32: So I'll press Control+Alt+Z or Command+Option+Z a 
few times to get back to that top point there.

01:37: I want to create a straight horizontal line 
out here inside the pasteboard, and so I need

01:42: to sever away this top control handle, and 
you do that by pressing the Alt key, or the

01:47: Option key on the Mac, and clicking on the anchor 
point. That gets rid of that outgoing control handle.

01:54: Then I can Shift+click over here in order 
to join these two points, not only with a

01:59: straight segment, but an 
absolutely horizontal one.

02:02: And then I'll Shift+click down around here in 
order to join those two points with a vertical

02:08: segment, and then I'll Shift+click way over 
here in order to join the last two points

02:13: with another horizontal segment.

02:15: All right, now I'm going to 
go ahead and zoom on in.

02:17: Now, my last point is a corner point, but 
I've got a curving segment coming up here,

02:22: so I need to turn it into a cusp, in which case, all 
you have to do is drag from the anchor point, like so.

02:29: So dragging from a corner point gives it a 
control handle in the direction of your drag.

02:34: All right, now I'm going to scroll over just 
a little bit here, and I'm going to drag from

02:38: this smooth point up and to the right, like so, 
in order to match the position of the control

02:43: handle opposite my cursor, so 
the one down and to the left there.

02:47: And then once I do, I'll release.

02:50: And I'll press the Control key, or the Command key on 
the Mac, to temporarily access the white arrow tool.

02:54: Now I'll go ahead and drag this control 
handle back to this closer location right there.

03:00: And notice, as soon as you start getting closer 
and closer to the anchor point, you have less

03:04: and less control, so you 
just have to be aware of that.

03:07: All right, now I'm going to make a few 
purposeful mistakes, because we'll come back and correct

03:11: these mistakes in the next movie.

03:13: I'll just click at the location of this 
anchor point, approximately; actually it wants to

03:18: be nudged up and over a little bit. 
And I'll click right there as well.

03:22: And so I've set up a couple of corner points where 
there should be a smooth points, and a cusp point.

03:28: And finally, I'm going to go 
ahead and close this path outline.

03:31: Now, here is probably the trickiest 
maneuver where this kind of stuff is concerned.

03:36: Notice, if I hover the Pen cursor over that 
first endpoint, then I'll see the little circle

03:40: showing me that I'm going 
to close the path outline.

03:43: And actually, this is a point at which the 
Rubber Band feature can come in handy.

03:47: I'm going to click on the 
gear icon, and turn it back on.

03:51: So we can see here that as I move my cursor 
around, I have a straight segment until the

03:55: moment I hover over that endpoint, 
and all of a sudden it curves.

03:59: And that's because it's showing me what would 
happen if I click at that point, and I go ahead

04:04: and accept the control handle 
that had already been drawn.

04:07: And so now that I've done that, I'll go ahead 
and Control+click or Command+click on that segment,

04:12: so you can see, there is the default 
control handle coming out of that smooth point.

04:16: That's not what I want at all, so I'll press 
Control+Alt+Z, or Command+Option+Z on the Mac,

04:20: to backstep, and reactivate my path.

04:23: Instead, what you do is you hover your cursor 
over that endpoint, and then you press and

04:28: hold the Alt key, or the Option key on the Mac,
and notice that flattens out the segment.

04:33: And you drag from that anchor point, and you 
drag in the opposite direction of where you

04:38: actually want to place the control handle; 
notice that, because if you were to drag in

04:43: the same direction, like that, then you would 
curve the path outline up and over that anchor

04:47: point, and obviously that's not what we want.

04:50: But it is a little bit confusing, because 
there is no control handle whatsoever underneath

04:56: your cursor; in fact, 
there's nothing going on.

04:58: In fact, you're performing a kind of mirror 
image maneuver, so that may seem like a really

05:03: wacky UI decision, but what Photoshop is 
trying to do is maintain consistency in terms of

05:08: how the Pen tool experience works.

05:10: All right, that goes ahead and 
deselects and deactivates the path.

05:14: So I'll press the Control key, or the Command key on 
the Mac, and click on that path outline to select it.

05:18: I'm actually going to move this point up a 
little bit, because I don't want his chin

05:22: to suddenly go in a different direction once 
it encounters the mask, so I'll drag that

05:27: anchor point up, and I'm dragging the 
control handle over and to the left.

05:30: And by the way, I'm doing all of this while the 
Control key, or the Command key on the Mac, is down.

05:35: And now I'll Spacebar+drag up, and I'll Control+drag 
or Command+drag this control handle upward.

05:39: All right, so at this point I've veered away 
from the template, so I might as well switch

05:44: back to the Layers panel, and turn 
the points & handles layer off.

05:48: That completes the path outline, more or less.

05:51: The problem is that I inserted a 
couple of clunky corner points.

05:55: I don't want those corner points.

05:57: I want the first one here to be a smooth 
point, and then I want this guy to be a cusp.

06:01: The question is, how do you convert interior 
points? And the answer is, I'll tell you in

06:05: the next movie.


 ** Using the Convert Point tool

00:00: Now, we have seen how to convert points.

00:02: For example, how to convert a smooth point 
to a cusp point, or a corner point to a cusp

00:06: point, by dragging or Alt dragging on it, using 
the Pen tool, but that only works with the

00:11: last point you drew; that is 
to say, with an endpoint.

00:15: If you try those maneuvers on an 
interior point, it's not really going to work.

00:18: For example, if I were going to click on an interior 
point in this path, I would delete it, like so.

00:24: So I will go ahead and press Control+Z, or 
Command+Z on the Mac, to undo that change.

00:29: The solution is to take advantage of a tool 
we haven't see yet, which is also available

00:34: in the Pen tool flyout menu, and that's this 
tool right there: the Convert Point tool. And

00:39: you can cycle to it, by the way, by 
pressing Shift+P a couple of times.

00:43: Notice, it has the most unremarkable tool 
icon, which is sort of the tip of an arrow, or a

00:48: caret, if you prefer.

00:50: And sure enough, the cursor looks like that caret 
when you hover it over an existing anchor point.

00:55: So you may recall, we've got two corner points 
here that require our attention, and here's

01:00: how we can modify them 
using the Convert Point tool.

01:03: The first option is to drag from the point, 
and if you do that, then you'll convert that

01:08: corner point into a smooth 
point, as you see me doing here.

01:12: You need to make sure you're 
dragging in the right direction.

01:14: It's often difficult to predict which direction 
you should go, but if you get it wrong in the

01:18: first place, then just drag the other way.

01:20: So that's one to work, and you can continue 
to do that, by the way; if you keep dragging

01:25: from that point, you are going to continue to 
create a smooth point over and over again.

01:30: If you want to turn a smooth point into a 
cusp instead, then you drag one of its control

01:36: handles, like so, and that will move the 
control handle in an independent direction.

01:40: If you want to convert either a smooth point 
or a cusp point to a corner point, you just

01:45: click on the anchor point, like so,

01:47: and that will get rid of all the control 
handles that are coming out of that point.

01:51: In my case, I want this point to be a smooth 
point, so I will go ahead and drag out from

01:55: it, like so, and then if I decide I want to 
make a change to this opposing control handle,

01:59: I am not going to drag it, because that would 
move in independently, and create a cusp point.

02:04: So I will press Control+Z, or 
Command+Z on the Mac, to undo that change.

02:08: Instead, what you want to do is press and hold 
the Control key, or the Command key on the Mac,

02:12: which will give you temporary access to the 
white arrow tool, and then you can move those

02:16: two control handles together, thus 
ensuring that you maintain the smooth point.

02:21: Now, it may seem like a lot of work 
here to switch between all these tools.

02:25: We now have three tools that you need to pay 
attention to; that is, the Pen tool, which allows

02:30: you to create the points in the first place.

02:32: The white arrow tool, which allows you to make 
standard modifications, and then of course,

02:37: we have got the Convert Point tool, which allows you 
to convert the character of an interior point.

02:43: So that means you are going to be 
switching around between tools quite a bit.

02:46: It turns out you can make all of those 
modifications using the Pen tool by itself.

02:51: So if the Pen tool is selected, you press 
and hold the Control key, or the Command key on

02:55: the Mac, in order to gain temporary access to 
that white arrow tool, so that eliminates

03:01: your need to switch back and forth to it.

03:04: And then if you want to gain access to the 
Convert Point tool, you press and hold the

03:08: Alt key, or the Option key on the Mac, and 
then hover your cursor over an existing anchor

03:13: point, and now with Alt or Option down, I 
can go ahead and drag from this point, for

03:19: example, in order to convert it to a 
smooth point, as we are seeing here.

03:23: And then if I keep the Alt or Option key down, 
and drag from this control handle, I can move

03:28: it up to a better location, and thus 
convert this anchor point to a cusp point.

03:33: And finally, if I Alt+Click or Option+Click 
on the point, I will go ahead and convert

03:37: it to a corner, as I had in the first place.

03:40: That's obviously now what I want, so I will 
press Control+Z, or Command+Z on the Mac, in order

03:44: to restore that cusp point.

03:46: All right, now comes the moment of truth.

03:48: As things stand now, our path outline exist 
entirely independently of the layer composition,

03:54: which is the way it is inside Photoshop layers, 
and alpha channels, and path outlines are utterly

04:01: and completely independent of eachother, 
until they're merged together inside the Layers

04:05: panel. And by merged together, I mean we need 
to convert this path outline to a vector mask.

04:11: So make sure the man layer is selected if 
you're working along with me, and then go

04:15: up to the options bar, and click on the Mask 
button in order to convert that path outline

04:20: to a vector mask, and then I will click on 
the vector mask to make it active, and click

04:24: again in order to hide the mask, so that 
we can see if we've got any problems.

04:28: Now, this portion of the 
shoulder looks really good.

04:30: However, right there we have got a little bit of 
brightness from the background, so I will

04:34: press the A key to switch back to my white arrow 
tool, and I will click the vector mask to select it.

04:39: Now let's go ahead and grab this anchor point 
right there, which seems to be the problem,

04:44: and nudge it down just a little bit.

04:46: So if you go too far into the 
sweater, who is going to notice?

04:49: That's just fine.

04:50: But people are going to notice if 
they see white edge fringing, obviously.

04:53: All right, now I will click on the vector 
mask in order to hide it, and we have got a

04:57: little bit of a bright edge on the side of 
his jaw there; looks a lot like Homer Simpson

05:02: from this vantage point.

05:04: I will go ahead and click on layer mask again 
in order to make it active, and then I will

05:09: select this path outline, and I will drag it 
up just a little bit, and I think that might

05:13: solve my problem, but it looks like it 
introduces a bigger problem up here along his cheek.

05:19: So let's go ahead and take this edge in, like 
so, and I might just need to nudge that anchor

05:24: point in a little bit by pressing the right 
arrow key a couple of times, and I will click,

05:28: once again, on the vector mask to hide it.

05:31: This is looking pretty darn good, I think.

05:33: I will go ahead and scroll up to 
his ear, which has some problems.

05:37: So I will bring back the path outline.

05:39: We have got a problem up here at the tip of 
the ear, so I will go ahead and drag this

05:42: control handle down, and we had a problem 
at the base of the ear as well, so I will

05:47: go ahead and move this point upward, like so. 
Make sure I am not clipping away too much

05:51: of his face, and I might drag this 
control handle up a little bit too.

05:57: And notice that these control handles are very long. 
I'm completely violating that two thirds rule.

06:01: I have got 100% of the segment covered, but 
after all, that's the way his ear is shaped.

06:06: All right, so I will go ahead and hide the 
vector mask once again. Looks like we are

06:10: pretty good, actually.

06:11: In fact, I think we are great!

06:13: So I will go ahead and press Control+0, or Command+0 
on the Mac, in order to zoom out from the image,

06:18: and then I will press the F key a couple of 
times in order to switch to the full screen

06:22: mode, and we might as well zoom in a little 
bit as well. And that is the final version

06:27: of this guys face masked against this ginormous leaf 
background, and by golly, he's masked with perfection,

06:35: thanks to the incredible level of precision 
afforded to you by the Pen tool, and the Paths

06:40: panel here inside Photoshop.
